occupational sub-division by some Paraiyans. Taccha Karaiy&#257;n has
been recorded as a name for some members of the Karaiy&#257;n fishing

<p><b>Talamala.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of K&#257;nikar. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>Talay&#257;ri.</b>&mdash;The Talay&#257;ri (talai, head) or chief
watchman, or Udd&#257;ri (saviour of the village), is a kind of
undepartmental village policeman, who is generally known as the
Tal&#257;ri. Among other duties, he has to follow on the track of
stolen cattle, to act as a guard over persons confined in the village
choultry (lock-up), to attend upon the head of the village during the
trial of petty cases, to serve processes, and distrain goods. In big
villages there are two or three Talay&#257;ris, in which case one is a
Paraiyan, who officiates in the Paraiya quarter. In parts of the Telugu
country, the Mutr&#257;chas, who are the village watchmen, are known as
Tal&#257;rivallu, or watchman people, and, in like manner, the
B&#275;dars are called Tal&#257;riv&#257;ndlu in the Kurnool and
Bellary districts.</p>
<p>It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the Tanjore district (1906), that
&ldquo;from the earliest years of the British occupation of the
country, fees were paid to the talaiy&#257;ri or village watchman. He
was probably survival of a state of society in which k&#257;valgars did
not exist, and his duties were, it seems, to look after the
villagers&rsquo; fields and threshing floors. At any rate, he continued
in existence even after the abolition of the k&#257;val system
(<i>see</i> Maravan), and was declared by the early Police Regulation
(XI of 1816) to be part of the regular police establishment.
Practically he did little real police duty, and in 1860, when the
mufassal police was reorganised, all claims to the services of the
talaiy&#257;ri as a servant of the State were formally abandoned, the
Inspector-General of Police having reported that any attempt to utilise
the talaiy&#257;ri body would be fruitless and unpopular.
Talaiy&#257;ris still continue to be employed and paid by the ryots
(cultivators) as the private guardians of their crops and harvested
grain. Recently, however, the district was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>brought into
line with the rest of the Presidency by the creation of a new force of
talaiy&#257;ris, who now perform the police duties assigned to such
persons elsewhere. They are provided with lathis (sticks) and badges,
and are a useful auxiliary to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>T&#257;li.</b>&mdash;&ldquo;The t&#257;li,&rdquo; Bishop Caldwell
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e506src" href="#xd21e506" name=
"xd21e506src">1</a> &ldquo;is the Hindu sign of marriage, answering to
the ring of European christendom. I have known a clergyman refuse to
perform a marriage with a t&#257;li, and insist upon a ring being used
instead. A little consideration will show that the scrupulous
conscience can find no rest for itself even in the ring; for, if the
ring is more Christian than the t&#257;li, it is only because its use
among Christians is more ancient. Every one knows that the ring has a
Pagan origin, and that, for this reason, it is rejected by
Quakers.&rdquo; &ldquo;The custom,&rdquo; Wagner informs us,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e509src" href="#xd21e509" name="xd21e509src">2</a>
&ldquo;of wearing the wedding ring on the fourth finger of the left
hand had unquestionably a Pagan origin. Both the Greeks and the Romans
called the fourth left-hand finger the medicated finger, and used it to
stir up mixtures and potions, out of the belief that it contained a
vein, which communicated directly with the heart, and therefore nothing
noxious could come in contact with it, without giving instant warning
to that vital organ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The marriage badge, as it occurs in Southern India, is, broadly
speaking, of two types. The one in use among the Tamil castes is oblong
in shape, with a single or double indentation at the base, and rounded
at the top. The corresponding bottu or sathamanam of the Telugu and
Canarese castes is a flat or cup-shaped disc. The t&#257;li in use
among various Malay&#257;lam castes at the t&#257;li-kettu ceremony is
a long cylinder. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>T&#257;li-kettu kaly&#257;nam</b> (t&#257;li-tying
marriage).&mdash;A ceremony gone through by N&#257;yar girls, and girls
of some other Malay&#257;lam castes, in childhood. Of those who gave
evidence before the Malabar Marriage Commission, some thought the
t&#257;li-kettu was a marriage, some not. Others called it a mock
marriage, a formal marriage, a sham marriage, fictitious marriage, a
marriage sacrament, the preliminary part of marriage, a meaningless
ceremony, an empty form, a ridiculous farce, an incongruous custom, a
waste of money, and a device for becoming involved in debt.
&ldquo;While,&rdquo; the Report states, &ldquo;a small minority of
strict conservatives still maintain that the t&#257;li-kettu is a real
marriage intended to confer on the bridegroom a right to cohabit with
the bride, an immense majority describe it as a fictitious marriage,
the origin of which they are at a loss to explain. And another large
section tender the explanation accepted by our President (Sir T.
Muttusami Aiyar), that in some way or other it is an essential caste
observance preliminary to the formation of sexual relations.&rdquo; In
summing up the evidence collected by him, Mr. Lewis Moore
states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e519src" href="#xd21e519" name=
"xd21e519src">3</a> that it seems to be proved beyond all reasonable
doubt that &ldquo;from the sixteenth century at all events, and up to
the early portion of the nineteenth century, the relations between the
sexes in families governed by marumakkath&#257;yam (inheritance in the
female line) were of as loose a description as it is possible to
imagine. The t&#257;li-kettu kaly&#257;nam, brought about by the
Br&#257;hmans, brought about no improvement, and indeed, in all
probability, made matters much worse by giving a quasi-religious
sanction to a fictitious marriage, which bears an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>unpleasant
resemblance to the sham marriage ceremonies performed among certain
inferior castes elsewhere as a cloak for prostitution (<i>see</i>
D&#275;va-d&#257;si). As years passed, some time about the opening of
the nineteenth century, the K&#275;rala mahatmyam and K&#275;ralolpathi
were concocted, probably by Namb&#363;dris, and false and pernicious
doctrines as to the obligations laid on the N&#257;yars by divine law
to administer to the lust of the Namb&#363;dris were disseminated
abroad. The better classes among the N&#257;yars revolted against the
degrading system thus established, and a custom sprang up, especially
in North Malabar, of making sambandham a more or less formal contract,
approved and sanctioned by the Karnavan (senior male) of the
tarwad<a class="noteref" id="xd21e527src" href="#xd21e527" name=
"xd21e527src">4</a> to which the lady belonged, and celebrated with
elaborate ceremony under the pudamuri (female cloth cutting) form. That
there was nothing analogous to the pudamuri prevalent in Malabar from
A.D. 1500 to 1800 may, I think, be fairly presumed from the absence of
all allusion to it in the works of the various European writers.&rdquo;
According to Act IV, Madras, 1896, sambandham means an alliance between
a man and woman, by reason of which they, in accordance with the custom
of the community to which they belong, or either of them belongs,
cohabit or intend to cohabit as husband and wife.</p>
<p><b>Tambala.</b>&mdash;The Tambalas are summed up, in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;Telugu-speaking temple priests. Their
social position differs in different localities. They are regarded as
Brahmans in God&#257;vari, Kistna and Nellore, and as S&#363;dras in
the other Telugu districts.&rdquo; It is noted, in the Census Report,
that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>Tambalas are described by C. P. Brown as a class of
beggars, who worship Siva, and who beat drums; secular priests, etc.
These men are generally S&#363;dras, but wear the sacred thread.
&ldquo;It is said that, during his peregrinations in the north,
Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya appointed Tamil Br&#257;hmans to perform temple
services in all the Saiva shrines. Hence the Telugu people, in the
midst of whom the Tamilians lived, called them the Tambalas (Tamils).
They are not now, however, regarded as Br&#257;hmans, whatever their
original position may have been. They will eat only with Br&#257;hmans.
Most of them are Saivites, and a few are Lingayats. The Smarta
Br&#257;hmans officiate as their priests at birth, marriage, and death
ceremonies. They do not eat animal food, and all their religious rites
are more or less like those of Br&#257;hmans. Their usual titles are
Aiya and Appa.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Tamb&#257;n.</b>&mdash;One of the divisions of Kshatriyas in
Travancore. (<i>See</i> Tirumalp&#257;d.)</p>
<p><b>Tambi</b> (younger brother).&mdash;A term of affection in the
Tamil country, used especially when a younger person is being
addressed. It is also recorded as an honorific title of N&#257;yars in
Travancore, and a suffix to the names of N&#257;yar sons of Travancore
sovereigns.</p>
<p><b>Tambir&#257;n.</b>&mdash;The name for Pand&#257;ram managers of
temples, <i>e.g.</i>, at Tiruv&#257;dudurai in Tanjore and Mailam in
South Arcot.</p>
<p><b>Tambur&#257;n.</b>&mdash;For the following note on the
R&#257;jahs or Tambur&#257;ns, I am indebted to the Travancore Census
Report, 1901. &ldquo;They form an endogamous community of Kshatriyas,
and live as seven families in Travancore. They are distinguished by the
localities in which they reside, viz., Mavelikkara, Ennaikk&#257;t,
Kartikapalli, Mariappalli, Tiruvalla, Pr&#257;ikkara, and Aranmula.
They are all related by blood, the connection between some of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>them being very close. Like the
K&#333;iltampur&#257;ns, all the members of their community observe
birth and death pollution with reference to each other. Their original
home is K&#333;lattun&#257;t in North Malabar, and their immigration
into Travancore, where the reigning family is of the
K&#333;lattun&#257;t stock, was contemporaneous, in the main, with the
invasion of Malabar by Tippu Sultan. The first family that came into
the country from K&#333;lattun&#257;t was the Putuppalli K&#333;vilakam
in the 5th century M.E. (Malabar era). The Travancore royal family then
stood in need of adoption. The then R&#257;jah arranged through a
Koiltampur&#257;n of Tatt&#257;rikk&#333;vilakam to bring from
K&#333;lattun&#257;t two princesses for adoption, as his negotiations
with the then K&#333;lattiri were fruitless. The Puttuppali
K&#333;vilakam members thus settled themselves at Kartikapalli, the
last of whom died in 1030 M.E. The next family that migrated was
Cheriyak&#333;vilakam, between 920 and 930 M.E. They also came for
adoption. But their right was disputed by another house,
Pallikk&#333;vilakam. They then settled themselves at Aranmula. The
third series of migrations were during the invasion of Malabar by Tippu
in 964 M.E. All the R&#257;jahs living there at the time came over to
Travancore, of whom, however, many returned home after a time.</p>
<p>The R&#257;jahs, like the K&#333;iltampur&#257;ns, belong to the
Yajurv&#275;da section of Dvijas, but follow the s&#363;tra laid down
by Baudh&#257;yana. Their g&#333;tra is that of Bhargava, <i>i.e.</i>,
Parasur&#257;ma, indicating in a manner that these are Kshatriyas who
were accepted by Parasur&#257;ma, the uncompromising Brahmin of the
Hindu Pur&#257;nas. They have all the Brahminical Samsk&#257;ras, only
the Brahmin priest does most of them on their behalf. Chaulam, or tuft
ceremony, is performed along with Upan&#257;yanam. The
Sam&#257;vartanam, or termination of the pupil stage, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>is
celebrated on the fourth day of the thread investiture. Instruction in
arms is then given to the Kshatriya boy, and is supposed to be kept up
until the requisite <span class="corr" id="xd21e567" title=
"Source: skil">skill</span> has been obtained. The t&#257;li-tying
(mangalya dh&#257;ranam or pallikkettu of a R&#257;ja lady) is done by
a K&#333;iltampur&#257;n, who thereafter lives with her as her married
husband. The Kanyak&#257;d&#257;nam, or giving away of the bride, is
performed by the priest who attends also to the other S&#257;straic
rites. The males take S&#363;dra consorts. If the first husband leaves
by death or otherwise, another K&#333;iltampur&#257;n may be accepted.
This is not called marriage, but k&#363;ttirikkuka (living
together).</p>
<p>At Sr&#257;dhas (memorial services), the Kart&#257;, or performer of
the ceremony, throws a flower as a mark of spiritual homage at the feet
of the Brahmins who are invited to represent the manes, and greets them
in the conventional form (namask&#257;ra). The priest does the other
ceremonies. After the invited Brahmins have been duly entertained,
oblations of cooked rice are offered to the ancestors by the Kart&#257;
himself.</p>
<p>They are to repeat the G&#257;yatri ten times at each Sandhya
prayer, together with the Panch&#257;kshara and the Asht&#257;kshara
mantras.</p>
<p>Their caste government is in the hands of the Namb&#363;tiri
Vaidikas. Their family priests belong to the class of Malay&#257;la
P&#333;ttis, known as Tiruveli P&#333;ttis.</p>
<p>Besides the ordinary names prevalent among K&#333;iltampur&#257;ns,
names such as Mart&#257;nda Varma, &#256;ditya Varma, and Udaya Varma
are also met with. Pet names, such as Kung&#257;ru, Kungappan,
Kung&#333;man, Kungunni, Unni and Ampu are common. In the Travancore
Royal House, the first female member always takes the name of Lakshmi
and the second that of Parvati. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9"
href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>T&#257;moli.</b>&mdash;A few members of this North India caste of
betel-leaf sellers have been returned at times of census. I am unable
to discover in what district they occur. T&#257;mbuli or T&#257;muli is
recorded as a caste of betel-leaf sellers in Bengal, and T&#257;mboli
as a caste carrying on a similar occupation in the Bombay
Presidency.</p>
<p><b>T&#257;naman&#257;du.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Valaiyan.</p>
<p><b>Tanda.</b>&mdash;The word literally refers to a settlement or
encampment of the Lamb&#257;dis, by some of whom it is, at times of
census, returned as a tribal synonym.</p>
<p><b>Tandan.</b>&mdash;It is recorded, in the Madras Census Report,
1891, that &ldquo;in Walluvan&#257;d and P&#257;lghat (in Malabar)
Tandan is a distinct caste. The ceremonies observed by Tandans are, in
general outline, the same as those of the southern Tiyyans, but the two
do not intermarry, each claiming superiority over the other. There is a
custom which prohibits the Tandan females of Walluvan&#257;d from
crossing a channel which separates that t&#257;luk from Mankara on the
P&#257;lghat side.&rdquo; The Tandans of Malabar are described by Mr.
F. Fawcett as a people allied to the Izhuvans, who observe the custom
of fraternal polyandry, which the Izhuvans abhor.</p>
<p>For the following note on the Tandans of Travancore, I am indebted
to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar.</p>
<p>The castemen are known as Ur&#257;lis to the south of Varkallay, and
Tandans to the north of it. In some places to the east of Kottarakaray,
they were popularly termed Mutalpattukar, or those who receive the
first perquisite for assistance rendered to carpenters. In the days
when there were no saws, the rough instruments of the Tandan served
their purpose. Hence some members of the caste were called Tacchan
(carpenter). Tandan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10"
name="pb10">10</a>]</span>is derived from the Sanskrit dandanam or
punishment, as, in ancient times, men of this caste were employed to
carry out the punishments that were inflicted by the authorities upon
offenders. For the execution of such punishments, the Tandans were
provided with swords, choppers and knives. As they were also told off
to guard the villages (&#363;r) of which they happened to be
inhabitants, they acquired the title of Ur&#257;li. In some places,
Tandans are also called V&#275;lans. Males and females have
respectively the title M&#363;ppan and M&#363;ppatti, meaning an elder.
In addressing members of higher castes, the Tandans call themselves
Kuzhiyan, or dwellers in pits.</p>
<p>The Tandans are said to have once belonged to the same caste as the
Izhuvans, but to have fallen away from that position. They must, in
times gone by, have joined the military service of the various States
in Malabar. They were, in some places, given rent-free lands, called
Ur&#257;li parambu, in return for the duties they were expected to
perform. With the return of peaceful times, their occupation changed,
and the climbing of palm trees, to extract the juice thereof, became
their most important calling. They are also largely engaged in the
manufacture of ropes. Many families still receive the mutalpattu, or
allowance from the carpenters.</p>
<p>The Tandans are divided into four endogamous sections, called
Ilanji, Puvar, Irunelli, and Pilakkuti.</p>
<p>The ornaments of the women are, besides the minnu, wreaths of red
and red and black beads. Nowadays the gold gn&#257;ttu of the
N&#257;yars is also worn. Tattooing is popular. Even males have a
crescent and a dot tattooed on the forehead, the corresponding mark in
females being a line from the nasal pit upwards. Among the devices
tattooed on the arms are the conch shell, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>lotus, snake, discus,
etc. In their food and drink the Tandans resemble the Iluvans.</p>
<p>The priests of the Tandans are called Tanda Kuruppus, and they are
also the caste barbers. The chief deity of the Tandans is
Bhadrak&#257;li, at whose shrines at Mandaikkad, Cranganore, and
Sarkkaray, offerings are regularly made. At the last place, a Tandan is
the priest. The chief days for the worship of this deity are Bharani
asterism in March and Patt&#257;mudayam in April. November is a
particularly religious month, and the day on which the Kartikay star
falls is exclusively devoted to worship. The first Sunday in January is
another religious occasion, and on that day cooked food is offered to
the rising sun. This is called Pogala. Maruta, or the spirit of
smallpox, receives special worship. If a member of the caste dies of
this disease, a small shed is erected in his memory either at his home
or near the local Bhadrak&#257;li shrine, and offerings of sweetmeats
and toddy are made to him on the 28th of Makaram (January-February).
Chitragupta, the accountant of Yama, the god of death, is worshipped on
the full-moon day in April-May. Ancestor worship is performed on the
new-moon day in July.</p>
<p>A girl&rsquo;s t&#257;li-tying ceremony, which is called
kazhuttukettu, takes place when she is between seven and twelve years
old. The bridegroom is a relative called Machchampi. The Kuruppu
receives a money present of 2&frac12; fanams for every t&#257;li tied
in his presence. Though more than one girl may go through the ceremony
in the same pandal (booth), each should have a separate bridegroom. The
relations between the bride and bridegroom are dissolved by the father
of the former paying the latter sixteen r&#257;si fanams. The daughter
of a man&rsquo;s paternal aunt or maternal uncle may be claimed as
murappen or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>lawful bride. The sambandham, or actual marriage,
takes place after a girl has reached puberty. A family is regarded as
out-caste, if she has not previously gone through the t&#257;li-tying
ceremony.</p>
<p>Only the eldest member of a family is cremated, the rest being
buried. Death pollution lasts for ten days. The anniversary of a death
is celebrated at the sea-shore, where cooked food, mixed with gingelly
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Sesamum</i>) is offered to the departed, and thrown
into the sea.</p>
<p><b>Tand&#257;n.</b>&mdash;The Tand&#257;n is the hereditary headman
of a Tiyan tara (village), and is a Tiyan by caste. He is appointed by
the senior R&#257;ni of the Zamorin&rsquo;s family, or by some local
R&#257;ja in territories outside the jurisdiction of the Zamorin. The
Tand&#257;n is the principal person in the decision of caste disputes.
He is expected to assist at the t&#257;li-tying, puberty, marriage and
pregnancy ceremonies of members of the caste. His formal permission is
required before the carpenter can cut down the areca palm, with which
the shed in which the t&#257;li is tied is constructed. In cases of
divorce, his functions are important. When a new house is built, a
house-warming ceremony takes place, at which the Tand&#257;n
officiates. Fowls are sacrificed, and the right leg is the
Tand&#257;n&rsquo;s perquisite. He is a man of importance, not only in
many affairs within his own caste, but also in those of other castes.
Thus, when a N&#257;yar dies, it is the Tand&#257;n&rsquo;s duty to get
the body burnt. He controls the washerman and barber of the tara, and
can withdraw their services when they are most needed. He officiates,
moreover, at marriages of the artisan classes.</p>
<p><b>Tangal&#257;n.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Paraiyan. The word
indicates one who may not stand near, in reference to their belonging
to the polluting classes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=

<p><b>Tang&#275;du.</b>&mdash;Tang&#275;du or Tang&#275;dla (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Cassia auriculata</i>) has been recorded as an exogamous
sept of K&#257;pu and Padma S&#257;l&#275;. The bark of this shrub is
one of the most valuable Indian tanning agents, and is, like myrabolams
(<i>Terminalia</i> fruits), used in the manufacture of indigenous
dyes.</p>

Rivers,<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n16a">5</a> of a division of the

<p><b>Telaga.</b>&mdash;&ldquo;The Telagas,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e690src" href="#xd21e690" name=
"xd21e690src">7</a> &ldquo;are a Telugu caste of cultivators, who were
formerly soldiers in the armies of the Hindu sovereigns of Telingana.
This may perhaps account for the name, for it is easy to see that the
Telugu soldiers might come to be regarded as the Telugus or Telagas
<i>par excellence</i>. The sub-divisions returned under this name show
that there has been some confusion between the Telagas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>proper,
and persons who are members of other Telugu castes. The Telagas are
Vaishnavites, and have Br&#257;hmans for their priests. Their customs
closely resemble those of the K&#257;pus. They eat flesh, but are not
allowed to drink liquor. They are usually farmers now, but many still
serve as soldiers, though their further recruitment has recently been
stopped. Their common titles are Naidu and Dora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Telagas and Vantaris (strong men), it is suggested
that they should be classed with the K&#257;pus, of which caste they
are an offshoot for the following reasons:&mdash;&rdquo;(1) Members of
the three classes admit that this is so; (2) a collation of the
intip&#275;rulu or septs shows that the same names recur among the
three classes; (3) all three interdine, and intermarriage between them
is not rare. A poor Telaga or Vantari often gives his daughter in
marriage to a rich K&#257;pu. The Telagas and Vantaris are highly
Br&#257;hmanised, and will have a Br&#257;hman for their guru, and get
themselves branded at his hands. A K&#257;pu is generally content with
a S&#257;t&#257;ni or Jangam. Though they do not differ in their
marriage and funeral rites from the K&#257;pus, they usually marry
their girls before puberty, and widow remarriage and divorce are
disallowed. A K&#257;pu is invariably a cultivator; a Vantari was in
olden days a sepoy, and, as such, owned in&#257;m (rent-free) lands.
Even now he has a prejudice against ploughing jir&#257;yati (ordinarily
assessed) lands, which a K&#257;pu has no objection to do. Similarly, a
Telaga takes pride in taking service under a Zamindar, but, unlike the
Vantari, he will plough any land. K&#257;pu women will fetch their own
water, and carry meals to the fields for their fathers and husbands.
The women of the other classes affect the g&#333;sha system, and the
men carry their own food, and fetch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15"
href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>water for domestic purposes, or,
if well-to-do, employ K&#257;pus for these services. It may be added
that rich K&#257;pus often exhibit a tendency to pass as
Telagas.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>T&#275;likula.</b>&mdash;The T&#275;likulas are summed up, in the
Madras Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;a Telugu oil-presser caste, which
should not be confused with Tellakula, a synonym for Ts&#257;kala, or
with Telli, a caste of Oriya oil-pressers.&rdquo; Telikula is a synonym
for the G&#257;niga or G&#257;ndla caste of oil-pressers, derived from
the oil (gingelly: <i lang="la-x-bio">Sesamum indicum</i>), whereas the
names G&#257;niga and G&#257;ndla refer to the oil-mill. In the
Northern Circars, the name T&#275;likula is used in preference to
G&#257;niga or G&#257;ndla, and the oil-pressers in that part of the
country are known as T&#275;likula-v&#257;ndlu. The T&#275;likulas are
Onteddu, <i>i.e.</i>, use a single bullock for working the oil-mill,
whereas, among the G&#257;nigas, there are both Onteddu and Rendeddu
sections, which employ one and two bullocks respectively.</p>
<p><b>Tellakula</b> (white clan).&mdash;Recorded, in the Census Report,
1901, as a synonym for Ts&#257;kala. According to the Rev. J.
Cain,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e716src" href="#xd21e716" name=
"xd21e716src">8</a> the Tellakulas are Telugu washermen
(Ts&#257;kalas), who, in consequence of having obtained employment as
peons in Government offices, feel themselves to be superior to other
members of their caste.</p>
<p><b>Telli.</b>&mdash;The Tellis are the oil-pressers of the Oriya
country, whose caste name is derived from telo, oil. They are
apparently divided into three endogamous sections, named Holodia,
Bolodia, and Khadi. The original occupation of the Holodias is said to
have been the cultivation and sale of turmeric. They may not carry
turmeric and other articles for sale on the back of bullocks, and
consequently use carts as a medium <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16"
href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>of transport thereof. And it is
further contrary to their caste rules even to assist in loading or
unloading packs carried by bullocks. The Bolodias receive their name
from the fact that they carry produce in the form of oil-seeds, etc.,
on pack bullocks, bolodo being Oriya for bullock. The Khadis are mainly
engaged in expressing various oils in oil-mills, and this occupation is
also carried on by some members of the other sections. All Tellis seem
to belong to one g&#333;tra, called Karthik&#275;swara. The caste title
is S&#257;hu. In social position the Tellis, unlike the Tamil
V&#257;niyans (oil-pressers), are on a par with the agricultural
castes, and are one of the panchap&#257;tako, or five castes from which
individuals are selected to decide serious issues which arise among the
Badh&#333;yis. The headman of the Tellis is called B&#275;hara, and he
is assisted by a Bhollobaya, and in some places apparently by another
officer called Pento.</p>
<p>It is considered by the Tellis as a breach of caste rules to sail in
a boat or ship. If a cow dies with a rope round its neck, or on the
spot where it is tethered, the family which owned it is under pollution
until purification has been effected by means of a pilgrimage, or by
bathing in a sacred river. The Holodias will not rear male calves at
their houses, and do not castrate their bulls. Male calves are disposed
of by sale as speedily as possible. Those Holodias who are illiterate
make the mark (nis&#257;ni) of a ball of turmeric paste as a substitute
for their autograph on documents. In like manner, the nis&#257;nis of
the Bolodias and Khadis respectively are the leather belt of a bullock
and curved pole of the oil-mill. Among nis&#257;nis used by other Oriya
castes, the following may be noted:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Korono (writer caste), style.</li>
<li>R&#257;vulo (temple servants), trident. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span></li>
<li>B&#257;vuri (basket-makers and earth-diggers), sickle.</li>
<li>Dh&#333;ba (washermen) fork used for collecting firewood.</li>
<li>Br&#257;hman, ring of dharba grass, such as is worn on ceremonial
occasions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In their marriage ceremonies, the Tellis observe the standard Oriya
type, with a few variations. On the day before the wedding, two young
married women carry two new pots painted white on their heads. To
support the pots thereon, a single cloth, with the two ends rolled up
to form a head-pad, must be used. The two women, accompanied by another
married woman carrying a new winnowing basket, and mokkuto (forehead
chaplet), proceed, to the accompaniment of the music of a chank shell
and pipes, to a temple, whereat they worship. On their way home, the
two girls, according to the custom of other Oriyas castes, go to seven
houses, at each of which water is poured into their pots. During the
marriage ceremony, after the ends of the cloths of the bride and
bridegroom have been tied together, they exchange myrabolams
(<i>Terminalia</i> fruits) and areca nuts. Until the close of the
ceremonies, they may not plunge into a tank (pond) or river, and, in
bathing, may not wet the head.</p>
<p>Most of the Tellis are Paramarthos, and follow the Chaitanya form of
Vaishnavism, but some are Smartas, and all worship T&#257;kur&#257;nis
(village deities).</p>

<p><b>Thanda Pulayan.</b>&mdash;For the following note, I am indebted
to Mr. L. K. Ananthakrishna Aiyar.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e845src"
href="#xd21e845" name="xd21e845src">10</a> The Thanda Pulayans
constitute a small division of the Pulayans, who dwell in South Malabar
and Cochin. The name is given to them because of the garment worn by
the females, made of the leaves of a sedge, called thanda (apparently
<i lang="la-x-bio">Scirpus articulatus</i>), which are cut into
lengths, woven at one end, and tied round the waist so that they hang
down below the knees. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href=
"#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>following story is told with regard
to the origin of this costume. A certain high-caste man, who owned
lands in those parts, chanced to sow seeds, and plant vegetables. He
was surprised to find that not a trace of what he sowed or planted was
to be seen on the following day. With a view to clearing up the
mystery, he kept a close watch during the night, and saw certain human
beings, stark naked, come out of a hole. They were pursued, and a man
and a woman were caught. Impressed with a sense of shame at their
wretched condition, the high-caste man threw his upper garment to the
male, but, having nothing to give as a covering for the woman, threw
some thanda leaves over her. The Thanda Pulayans are also called Kuzhi
Pulayans, as they were found emerging from a pit (kuzhi). The leafy
garment is said to be fast going out of fashion, as M&#257;ppillas, and
others who own the Pulayans, compel them to wear cotton cloths.
According to the Rev. W. J. Richards, a division of the Pulayans, who
are called Kanna Pulayans, and found near Alleppey, wear rather better,
and more artistically made aprons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e853src"
href="#xd21e853" name="xd21e853src">11</a></p>
<p>The following legend is current regarding the origin of the Thanda
Pulayans. In the south, the Pulayans are divided into the eastern and
western sections. The former were the slaves of Duryodhana, and the
latter were attached to the P&#257;ndus. These formed the two rival
parties in the war of the Mah&#257;baratha, and the defeat of
Duryodhana was the cause of their degradation.</p>
<p>The Thanda Pulayans appear to have been the slaves of the soil till
1854, when they were emancipated. Even now, their condition has not
undergone much <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>material improvement. Though they are left more to
themselves, they still work for farmers or landlords for a daily wage
of paddy (unhusked rice). If they run away, they are brought back, and
punished. There is a custom that, when a farmer or landlord wants a few
Pulayans to work in the fields, he obtains their services on payment of
fifteen to twenty rupees to them, or to their master. When a
Pulayan&rsquo;s services are thus obtained, he works for his new master
for two edangalis of paddy a day. They can obtain their liberation on
the return of the purchase-money, which they can never hope to earn.
Having no property which they can claim as their own, and conscious
perhaps that their lot will be the same wherever they go, they remain
cheerful and contented, drudging on from day to day, and have no
inclination to emigrate to places where they can get higher wages. The
Cherumars of Palgh&#257;t, on the contrary, enjoy more freedom. Many go
to the Wyn&#257;d, and some to the Kolar gold-fields, where they
receive a good money-wage. The Thanda Pulayans work, as has been said,
for some landlord, who allows them small bits of land. The trees
thereon belong to the master, but they are allowed to enjoy their
produce during their residence there. When not required by the master,
they can work where they like. They have to work for him for six
months, and sometimes throughout the year. They have little to do after
the crop has been garnered. They work in the rice-fields, pumping
water, erecting bunds (mud embankments), weeding, transplanting, and
reaping. Men, women, and children may be seen working together. After a
day&rsquo;s hard work, in the sun or rain, they receive their wages,
which they take to the nearest shop, called mattupitica (exchange
shop), where they receive salt, chillies, etc., in exchange for a
portion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>of the paddy, of which the remainder is cooked.
The master&rsquo;s field must be guarded at night against the
encroachment of cattle, and the depredations of thieves and wild
beasts. They keep awake by shouting aloud, singing in a dull monotone,
or beating a drum. Given a drink of toddy, the Pulayans will work for
any length of time. It is not uncommon to see them thrashed for slight
offences. If a man is thrashed with a thanda garment, he is so much
disgraced in the eyes of his <span class="corr" id="xd21e864" title=
"Source: fellowmen">fellow men</span>, that he is not admitted into
their society. Some improve their condition by becoming converts to
Christianity. Others believe that the spirits of the departed would be
displeased, if they became Christians.</p>
<p>The Thanda Pulayan community is divided into exogamous illams, and
marriage between members of the same illam is forbidden. Their
habitations are called matams, which are miserable huts, supported on
wooden posts, sometimes in the middle of a paddy field, with walls of
reeds, bamboo mats or mud, and thatched with grass or cocoanut leaves.
A few earthen pots, bamboo vessels, and cocoanut shells constitute
their property. They are denied admission to the markets, and must
stand at a distance to make their purchases or sales.</p>
<p>Pulayan girls are married either before or after attaining puberty,
but there is special ceremony, which is performed for every girl during
her seventh or eighth year. This is called thanda kaly&#257;nam, or
thanda marriage. It consists in having the girl dressed at an
auspicious hour in the leafy garment by a woman, generally a relative,
or, in her absence, by one selected for the purpose. The relations and
friends are entertained at a feast of curry and rice, fish from the
backwater, and toddy. Prior to this ceremony, the girl is destitute of
clothing, except for a strip of areca bark. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the marriage ceremony, the t&#257;li (marriage badge) is made of
a piece of a conch shell (<i lang="la-x-bio">Turbinella rapa</i>),
which is tied on the bride&rsquo;s neck at an auspicious hour. She is
taken before her landlord, who gives her some paddy, and all the
cocoanuts on the tree, beneath which she happens to kneel. When the
time has come for her to be taken to the hut of the bridegroom, one of
her uncles, taking her by the hand, gives her into the charge of one of
her husband&rsquo;s uncles. On the third morning, her paternal and
maternal uncles visit her at the hut of the bridegroom, by whom they
are entertained. They then return, with the bride and bridegroom, to
the home of the former, where the newly-married couple stay for three
days. To ascertain whether a marriage will be a happy one, a conch
shell is spun round. If it falls to the north, it predicts good
fortune; if to the east or west, the omens are favourable; if to the
south, very unfavourable.</p>
<p>The Thanda Pulayans follow the makkath&#257;yam law of inheritance
(from father to son). They have their tribal assemblies, the members of
which meet together on important occasions, as when a woman is charged
with adultery, or when there is a theft case among them. All the
members are more or less of equal status, and no superior is
recognised. They swear by the sun, raising their hands, and saying
&ldquo;By the sun I did not.&rdquo; Other oaths are &ldquo;May my eyes
perish&rdquo; or &ldquo;May my head be cut off by lightning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every kind of sickness is attributed to the influence of some demon,
with whom a magician can communicate, and discover a means of
liberation. The magician, when called in professionally, lights a fire,
and seats himself beside it. He then sings, mutters some mantrams
(prayers), and makes a discordant noise on his iron plate (kokkara).
The man or woman, who is possessed by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>the demon, begins to make
unconscious movements, and is made to speak the truth. The demon,
receiving offerings of fowls, sheep, etc., sets him or her free. A form
of ceremonial, called urasikotukkuka, is sometimes performed. At a
place far distant from the hut, a leaf, on which the blood of a fowl
has been made to fall, is spread on the ground. On a smaller leaf,
chunam (lime) and turmeric are placed. The person who first sets eyes
on these becomes possessed by the demon, and sets free the individual
who was previously under its influence. In the event of sickness, the
sorcerer is invited to the hut. He arrives in the evening, and is
entertained with food, toddy, and betel. He then takes a tender
cocoanut, flower of the areca palm, and some powdered rice, which he
covers over with a palm leaf. The sick person is placed in front
thereof, and a circle is drawn round him. Outside the circle, an iron
stylus is stuck in the ground. The demon is supposed to be confined
within the circle, and makes the patient cry out &ldquo;I am in pai
(influence of the ghost) and he is beating me,&rdquo; etc. With the
promise of a fowl or sheep, or offerings thereof on the spot, the demon
is persuaded to take its departure. Sometimes, when the sorcerer visits
a house of sickness, a rice-pan containing three betel leaves, areca
nuts, paddy, tulsi (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ocimum sanctum</i>), sacred
ashes, conch and cowry (<i lang="la-x-bio">Cypr&aelig;a moneta</i>)
shells, is placed in the yard. The sorcerer sits in front of the pan,
and begins to worship the demon, holding the shells in his hands, and
turning to the four points of the compass. He then observes the omens,
and, taking his iron plate, strikes it, while he chants the names of
terrible demons, Mullva, Karink&#257;li, Aiyinar, and Villi, and utters
incantations. This is varied by dancing, to the music of the iron
plate, sometimes from evening till noon on the following day.

that he has committed some great sin, and proceeds to make confession,
when a small money fine is inflicted, which is spent on toddy for those
who are assembled. The Thanda Pulayans practice maranakriyas, or
sacrifices to certain demons, to help them in bringing about the death
of an enemy or other person. Sometimes affliction is supposed to be
brought about by the enmity of those who have got incantations written
on a palm leaf, and buried in the ground near a house by the side of a
well. A sorcerer is called in to counteract the evil charm, which he
digs up, and destroys.</p>

<p>When a member of the tribe has died an unnatural death, a man, with
a fowl and sword in his hands, places another man in a pit which has
been dug, and walks thrice round it with a torch. After an hour or two,
the man is taken out of the pit, and goes to a distance, where certain
ceremonies are performed.</p>
<p>The Thanda Pulayans worship the gods of Br&#257;hmanical temples at
a distance of nearly a quarter of a mile. A stone is set up in the
ground, on which they place tender cocoanuts and a few puttans (Cochin
coins). A temple servant takes these to the priest, who sends in return
some sandal paste, holy water, and flowers. They worship, as has been
already hinted, demons, and also the spirits of their ancestors, by
which small brass figures of males and females representing the pretas
(ghosts) are supposed to be possessed. They worship, among others,
Kandakarnan, Kodunk&#257;li, Bhairavan, and Arukola pretas, who are
lodged in small huts, and represented by stones. In the month of May,
they celebrate a festival, which lasts for several days. Chrysanthemum
and thumba (apparently <i lang="la-x-bio">Leucas aspera</i>) flowers
are used in the performance of worship, and paddy, beaten rice,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>tender cocoanuts, toddy, etc., are offered up.
There is a good deal of singing, drum-beating and devil-dancing by men
and women, who on this occasion indulge liberally in toddy. The
P&#257;ndavas, whom they call Anju Thamburakkal, are favourite deities.
They devise various plans for warding off the evil influence of demons.
Some, for example, wear rolls of palm leaf, with incantations written
on them, round their necks. Others hang baskets in the rice fields,
containing peace offerings to the gods, and pray for the protection of
the crop. Wherever there is a dense forest, M&#257;tan and K&#257;li
are supposed to dwell, and are worshipped. From the end of November to
April, which is the slack season, the Thanda Pulayans go about dancing
from hut to hut, and collecting money to purchase fowls, etc., for
offerings. Club-dancing is their favourite amusement, and is often
indulged in at night by the light of a blazing fire. The dancers, club
in hand, go round in concentric circles, keeping time to the songs
which they sing, striking each other&rsquo;s clubs, now bending to ward
off a blow on the legs, or rising to protect the head.</p>
<p>The dead are buried, and lighted torches are set up all round the
grave, on to which the relations of the dead person throw three
handfuls of rice. Near it, squares are made in rice flour, in each of
which a leaf with rice flour and paddy, and a lighted torch or wick is
placed. The chief mourner, who should be the son or nephew, carrying a
pot of water, goes several times round the grave, and breaks the pot
over the spot where the head rests. A few grains of rice are placed at
the four corners of the grave, and a pebble is laid on it, with
mantrams to keep off jackals, and to prevent the spirit from molesting
people. Every morning the chief mourner goes to the grave, and makes
offerings of boiled rice, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>gingelly (<i lang="la-x-bio">Sesamum
indicum</i>) seeds, and karuka grass. On the fourteenth day, he has an
oil-bath, and, on the following day, the Pulayans of the village (kara)
have a feast, with singing and beating of drums. On the sixteenth day,
which is pulakuli or day of purification, the chief mourner makes
offerings of rice balls, the guests are fed, and make a present of
small coin to the songster who has entertained them. Similar offerings
of rice balls are made to the spirit of the deceased person on the
new-moon day in the month of Kartigam. During the period of pollution,
the chief mourner has to cook his own food. The spirits of deceased
ancestors are called Chavar (the dead), and are said to manifest
themselves in dreams, especially to near relations, who speak in the
morning of what they have seen during the night. They even say that
they have held conversation with the deceased. The Rev. W. J. Richards
informs us that he once saw &ldquo;a little temple, about the size of a
large rabbit-hutch, in which was a plank for the spirits of the
deceased ancestors to come and rest upon. The spirits are supposed to
fish in the backwaters, and the phosphorescence, sometimes seen on the
surface of the water, is taken as an indication of their
presence.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e913src" href="#xd21e913"

<p>The Thanda Pulayans will not eat with the Ull&#257;dans or Parayans,
but stand at a distance of ninety feet from Br&#257;hmans and other
high-caste people. They are short of stature and dark-skinned. Like the

to be noted is that people such as the members of the well-known

Report, 1901, as &ldquo;a Canarese synonym for the Tamil Palli; applied
also by the Canarese people to any Tamil S&#363;dras of the lower
castes.&rdquo; In parts of the Mysore country, the Tamil language is
called Tigalu, and the Canarese M&#257;dhva Br&#257;hmans speak of
Tamil Smarta Br&#257;hmans as Tigalaru.</p>
<p>Some of the Tigalas, who have settled in Mysore, have forgotten
their mother-tongue, and speak only Canarese, while others,
<i>e.g.</i>, those who live round about Bangalore, still speak Tamil.
In their type of cranium they occupy a position intermediate between
the dolichocephalic Pallis and the sub-brachy cephalic Canarese
classes.</p>
<p>The difference in the type of cranium of the Tigalas and Tamil
Pallis is clearly brought by the following tabular statements of their
cephalic indices:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Tigalas are kitchen and market gardeners, and cultivate the
betel vine. They apparently have three divisions, called Ulli (garlic
or onions), El&#275; (leaf), and Arava (Tamil). Among the Ulli Tigalas,
several sub-divisions, and septs or budas named after deities or
prominent members of the caste, exist, <i>e.g.</i>:&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>I. Lakkamma&mdash;
<ul>
<li>T&#333;ta d&#275;varu (garden god).</li>
<li>Dodda d&#275;varu (big or chief god).</li>
<li>Dodda Narasayya.</li>
<li>Dodda Nanjappa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>II. Ellamm&#257;&mdash;
<ul>
<li>Narasayya.</li>
<li>Muddanna.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>III. Sidde d&#275;varu.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Tigalas have a headman, whose office is hereditary, and who is
assisted by a caste servant called Mudr&#275;. Council meetings are
usually held at a fixed spot, called g&#333;ni mara katt&#275; or
mudr&#275; g&#333;ni mara katt&#275;, because those summoned by the
Mudr&#275; assemble beneath a g&#333;ni (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus
mysorensis</i>) tree, round which a stone platform is erected. The tree
and platform being sacred, no one may go there on wearing shoes or
sandals. The members of council sit on a woollen blanket spread before
the tree.</p>
<p>Like the Pallis or Vanniyans, the Tigalas call themselves Agni
Vanni, and claim to be descended from the fire-born hero Agni
Bannir&#257;ya. In connection with the Tigalas who have settled in the
Bombay Presidency, it is noted<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1234src"
href="#xd21e1234" name="xd21e1234src">14</a> that &ldquo;they are a
branch of the Mysore Tigalas, who are Tamil Palli emigrants from the
Madras Presidency, and, like the Palli, claim a Kshatriya
origin.&rdquo; The Tigalas possess a manuscript, said to be a copy of a
s&#257;sana at Conjeeveram (K&#257;nchi), from which the following
extracts are taken. &ldquo;This is a K&#257;nchi s&#257;sana published
by Aswaththa Narayansw&#257;mi, who was induced to do so by the god
Varadar&#257;ja of <span class="corr" id="xd21e1237" title=
"Source: Conjeever&#257;m">Conjeeveram</span>. This s&#257;sana is
written to acquaint the descendants of the Mah&#257;purusha Agni
Bannir&#257;ya with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32"
name="pb32">32</a>]</span>the origin, doings, and g&#333;tra of their
ancestor Bannir&#257;ya. This Bannir&#257;ya sprang from fire, and so
is much beloved by Vishnu the many-armed, the many-eyed, and the bearer
of the chank and chakram, and who is no other than Narayana, the lord
of all the worlds great and small, and the originator of the V&#275;das
and Vedanta.... All those who see or worship this s&#257;sana relating
to Agni Bannir&#257;ya, who obtained boons from the Trimurthis,
D&#275;vatas, and Rishis, and who is the ancestor of the Tigalas, will
be prosperous, and have plenty of grain and children. Those who speak
lightly of this caste will become subject to the curses of
Bannir&#257;ya, Trimurthis, Rishis, and D&#275;vas. The glory of this
s&#257;sana is great, and is as follows:&mdash;The keeping and
worshipping of this pur&#257;na will enable the Tigalas of the
Karnataka country to obtain the merit of surapadavi (the state of
D&#275;vas), merit of doing p&#363;ja to a thousand lingams, a lakh of
cow gifts, and a hundred kannikad&#257;nams (gifts of virgins for
marriage).&rdquo; The s&#257;sana is said to have been brought to the
Canarese country because of a quarrel between the Pallis and the
Tigalas at the time of a Tigala marriage. The Tigalas were prevented
from bringing the various biruthus (insignia), and displaying them. The
s&#257;sana was brought by the Tigalas, at an expenditure of Rs. 215,
which sum was subsequently recovered from the Pallis.</p>
<p>Tigala occurs further as the name of a sub-division of Holeya.</p>
<p><b>Tikk&#275;</b> (gem).&mdash;A g&#333;tra of Kurni.</p>
<p><b>Ti</b> (fire) <b>Kollan</b>.&mdash;A sub-division of Kollan.</p>
<p><b>Tinda</b> (polluting).&mdash;A sub-division of Kanisan. Tinda

<p><b>Tirumalp&#257;d.</b>&mdash;Tirumalp&#257;d has been summed up as
&ldquo;one of the four divisions of Kshatriyas in Travancore. The term,
in its literal sense, conveys the idea of those who wait before kings.
In medi&aelig;val times the <span class="corr" id="xd21e1276" title=
"Source: Tirumal p&#257;ds">Tirumalp&#257;ds</span> were commanders of
armies.&rdquo; By Mr. Wigram<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1279src" href=
"#xd21e1279" name="xd21e1279src">15</a> Tirumalp&#257;d is defined as a
member of a Royal Family. In the Madras Census Report, 1891, it is
stated that &ldquo;there are two Tirumalp&#257;ds, one a S&#257;manta,
and the other a so-called Kshatriya. The former observes customs and
manners exactly similar to Er&#257;dis and Nedung&#257;dis. In fact,
these are all more or less interchangeable terms, members of the same
family calling themselves indifferently Er&#257;di or Tirumalp&#257;d.
The Kshatriya Tirumalp&#257;d wears the sacred thread, and the rites he
performs are similar to those of Br&#257;hmans, whose dress he has also
adopted. He has, however, like N&#257;yars, t&#257;li-kettu and
sambandham separately. His females take Namb&#363;diri consorts by
preference, but may have husbands of their own caste. Their inheritance
is in the female line, as among N&#257;yars and S&#257;mantas.
Generally the females of this caste furnish wives to Namb&#363;diris.
The touch of these females does not pollute a Namb&#363;diri as does
that of N&#257;yars and S&#257;mantas, and, what is more,
Namb&#363;diris <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>may eat their food. The females are called
Nambasht&#257;diri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following note on <span class="corr" id="xd21e1286" title=
"Source: Tamb&#257;ns">Tamp&#257;ns</span> and Tirumalp&#257;ds, I am
indebted to the Travancore Census Report, 1901. &ldquo;The Tamp&#257;ns
and Tirumalp&#257;ts come under the category of Malabar Kshatriyas.The
word Tamp&#257;n is a contraction of Tampur&#257;n, and at one time
denoted a ruling people. When they were divested of that authority by
the Ilayetattu Svar&#363;pam, they are said to have fallen from the
status of Tampur&#257;ns to Tamp&#257;ns. Their chief seat is the
Vaikam t&#257;luk. The Tirumalp&#257;ts do not seem to have ruled at
all. The word Tirumulp&#257;tu indicates those that wait before kings.
There is an old Sanskrit verse, which describes eight classes of
Kshatriyas as occupying K&#275;rala from very early times, namely (1)
Bh&#363;p&#257;la or Mah&#257; R&#257;ja, such as those of Travancore
and Cochin, (2) R&#257;jaka or R&#257;jas, such as those of Mavelikara
and Kotungall&#363;r, (3) K&#333;si or K&#333;iltampur&#257;n, (4)
Purav&#257;n or Tamp&#257;n, (5) Sr&#299;pur&#333;gama or
Tirumulp&#257;t, (6) Bhand&#257;ri or Pant&#257;rattil, (7)
Audv&#257;hika or Tirumalp&#257;t, (8) Ch&#275;ta or S&#257;manta. From
this list it may be seen that two classes of Tirumulp&#257;ts are
mentioned, namely, Sr&#299;pur&#333;gamas who are the waiters at the
R&#257;ja&rsquo;s palace, and the Audv&#257;hikas who perform
Udv&#257;ha or wedding ceremony for certain castes. Both these,
however, are identical people, though varying in their traditional
occupations. The chief seats of the Tirumulp&#257;ts are Shertallay and
Tiruvalla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tamp&#257;ns and Tirumulp&#257;ts are, for all purposes of
castes, identical with other Malabar Kshatriyas. Every Tamp&#257;n in
Travancore is related to every other Tamp&#257;n, and all are included
within one circle of death and birth pollution. Their manners and
customs, too, are exactly like those of other Kshatriyas. They are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>invested with the sacred thread at the sixteenth
year of age, and recite the G&#257;yatri (hymn) ten times thrice a day.
The Namb&#363;tiri is the family priest, and (death) pollution lasts
for eleven days. The Kettuk&#257;lyanam, or t&#257;li-tying ceremony,
may be performed between the seventh and the fourteenth year of age.
The t&#257;li is tied by the &#256;ryappattar, while the
Namp&#363;tiris recite the V&#275;dic hymns. Their consorts are usually
Namp&#363;tiris, and sometimes East Coast Br&#257;hmans. Like all the
Malabar Kshatriyas, they follow the marumakkath&#257;yam system of
inheritance (through the female line). Tamp&#257;ns and
Tirumulp&#257;ts are often the personal attendants of the Travancore
Mahar&#257;jas, whom they serve with characteristic fidelity and
devotion.The Tirumulp&#257;ts further perform the t&#257;li-tying
ceremony of the N&#257;yar aristocracy.</p>
<p>The names of the Tirumulp&#257;ts and Tamp&#257;ns are the same as
those of other classes of Kshatriyas. The title Varma is uniformly
added to their names. A few families among these, who once had ruling
authority, have the titular suffix Bhand&#257;rattil, which is
corrupted into Pant&#257;rattil. The Tamp&#257;ns call themselves in
documents K&#333;viladhik&#257;rikal, as they once had authority in
k&#333;vils or palaces.</p>
<p><b>Tirum&#257;n</b> (holy deer).&mdash;An exogamous section of
Kallan.</p>
<p><b>Tirumudi</b> (holy knot).&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, as &ldquo;bricklayers, whose women are usually
prostitutes; found chiefly in Salem and Coimbatore. They are either
V&#275;ttuvans or Kaik&#333;lans. Kaik&#333;lan women, when they are
dedicated to the temple, are supposed to be united in wedlock with the
deity.</p>
<p><b>Tiruvalluvan.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Valluvan. Tiruvalluvar,
the author of the Kur&#257;l, is said to have belonged to the Valluva
caste. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=

<p><b>Tiru-vilakku-nagarattar</b> (dwellers in the city of holy
lamps).&mdash;A name assumed by V&#257;niyans (oil-pressers).</p>
<p><b>Tiyadi.</b>&mdash;A synonym of the Tiy&#257;ttunni section of
Ambalav&#257;sis (<i>see</i> Unni).</p>
<p><b>Tiyan.</b>&mdash;The Tiyans, and Izhuvans or Iluvans, are the
Malay&#257;lam toddy-drawing castes of Malabar, Cochin, and Travancore.
The following note, except where otherwise indicated, is taken from an
account of the Tiyans of Malabar by Mr. F. Fawcett.</p>
<p>The Tiyans in Malabar number, according to the census returns,
512,063, or 19&middot;3 per cent. of the total population. The
corresponding figures for the Izhuvans are 101,638, or 3&middot;8 per
cent. The Tiyans have been summed up<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1329src" href="#xd21e1329" name="xd21e1329src">16</a> as the
middle class of the west coast, who cultivate the ground, take service
as domestics, and follow trades and professions&mdash;anything but
soldiering, of which they have an utter abhorrence.</p>
<p>The marumakkat&#257;yam system (inheritance through the female
line), which obtains in North Malabar, has favoured temporary
connections between European men and Tiyan women, the children
belonging to the mother&rsquo;s tarvad. Children bred under these
conditions, European influence continuing, are often as fair as
Europeans. It is recorded, in the Report of the Malabar Marriage
Commission, 1894, that &ldquo;in the early days of British rule, the
Tiyan women incurred no social disgrace by consorting with Europeans,
and, up to the last generation, if the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1334" title="Source: Sudra">S&#363;dra</span> girl could boast of
her <span class="corr" id="xd21e1337" title=
"Source: Brahman">Br&#257;hman</span> lover, the Tiyan girl could show
more substantial benefits from her alliance with a white man of the
ruling race. Happily, the progress of education, and the growth of a
wholesome public <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>opinion, have made shameful the position of a
European&rsquo;s concubine; and both races have thus been saved from a
mode of life equally demoralising to each.&rdquo; On this point, Mr. L.
K. Anantha Krishna Iyer writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1342src" href="#xd21e1342" name="xd21e1342src">17</a> &ldquo;It
is true that there is an elevation both physically and mentally in the
progeny of such a parentage. On making enquiries about this, I learn
from a respectable and educated Tiyan gentleman that this union is
looked upon with contempt by the respectable class of people, and by
the orthodox community. I am further informed that such women and
children, with their families, are under a ban, and that respectable
Tiya gentlemen who have married the daughters of European parentage are
not allowed to enjoy the privileges of the caste. There are, I hear,
several such instances in Calicut, Tellicherry, and Cannanore. Women of
respectable families do not enter into such connection with
Europeans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is commonly supposed that the Tiyans and Izhuvans came from
Ceylon. It is recorded, in the South Canara Manual, that &ldquo;it is
well known that both before and after the Christian era there were
invasions and occupations of the northern part of Ceylon by the races
then inhabiting Southern India, and Malabar tradition tells us that
some of these Dravidians migrated again from &#298;ram or Ceylon
northwards to Travancore and other parts of the west coast of India,
bringing with them the cocoanut or southern tree (<i>tengina mara</i>),
and being known as T&#299;vars (islanders) or &#298;ravars, which names
have since been altered to T&#299;yars and <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1350" title="Source: &#298;lavars">Ilavars</span>. Dr. Caldwell
derives &#298;ram from the Sanskrit Simhala through the Pali Sihala by
the omission of the initial S.&rdquo; It is noted by Bishop
Caldwell<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1353src" href="#xd21e1353" name=
"xd21e1353src">18</a> that there are traces of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>a common
origin of the Iluvans and Sh&#257;nars, Sh&#257;nar (or
Sh&#275;n&#275;r), for instance, being a title of honour amongst the
Travancore Ilavars. And it is further recorded<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1358src" href="#xd21e1358" name="xd21e1358src">19</a> that there
is a tradition that the Sh&#257;nars came originally from Ceylon. The
Izhuvans are supposed to derive their caste name from Izha dwipa
(island) or Simhala dwipa (both denoting Ceylon). In a Tamil Puranic
work, quoted by Mr. Anantha Krishna Iyer, mention is made of a King
Illa of Ceylon, who went to Chidambaram in the Tamil country of
Southern India, where a religious discussion took place between the
Buddhist priests and the Saivite devotee Manickavachakar in the
presence of King Illa, with the result that he was converted to the
Saivite faith. From him the Iluvans are said to be descended.</p>
<p>The Tiyans are always styled Izhuvan in documents concerning land,
in which the Zamorin, or some Br&#257;hman or N&#257;yar grandee,
appears as landlord. The Tiyans look down on the Izhuvans, and
repudiate the relationship. Yet they cannot but submit to be called
Izhuvan in their documents, for their N&#257;yar or Br&#257;hman
landlord will not let them have the land to cultivate, unless they do
so. It is a custom of the country for a man of a superior caste to
pretend complete ignorance of the caste of an individual lower in the
social scale. Thus, in the Wyn&#257;d, where there are several jungle
tribes, one is accustomed to hear a man of superior caste pretending
that he does not know a Paniyan from a Kurumba, and deliberately
miscalling one or the other, saying &ldquo;This Paniyan,&rdquo; when he
knows perfectly well that he is a Kurumba. It is quite possible,
therefore, that, though Tiyans are written down as Izhuvans, the two
were not supposed to be identical. State <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>regulations keep the
Izhuvans of Cochin and Travancore in a position of marked social
inferiority, and in Malabar they are altogether unlettered and
uncultured. On the other hand, the Tiyans of Malabar provide
Magistrates, Sub-Judges, and other officials to serve His
Majesty&rsquo;s Government. It may be noted that, in 1907, a Tiya lady
matriculate was entertained as a clerk in the Tellicherry
post-office.</p>
<p>A divagation must be made, to bring the reader to a comprehension of
the custom surrounding m&#257;ttu, a word signifying change,
<i>i.e.</i>, change of cloth, which is of sufficient importance to
demand explanation. When a man or woman is outcasted, the washerwoman
(or man) and the barber of the community (and no other is available)
are prohibited from performing their important parts in the ceremonies
connected with birth, death, and menstruation. A person who is in a
condition of impurity is under the same conditions; he or she is
temporarily outcasted. This applies to Namb&#363;tiris and N&#257;yars,
as well as to the Tiyans. Now the washerwoman is invariably of the
Tiyan caste. There are Mann&#257;ns, whose hereditary occupation is
washing clothes for Namb&#363;tiris and N&#257;yars, but, for the most
part, the washerwoman who washes for the N&#257;yar lady is of the
Tiyan caste. A woman is under pollution after giving birth to a child,
after the death of a member of her tarvad, and during menstruation. And
the pollution must be removed at the end of the prescribed period, or
she remains an outcaste&mdash;a very serious thing for her. The
impurity is removed by receiving a clean cloth from the washerwoman,
and giving in exchange her own cloth to be washed. This is m&#257;ttu,
and, be it noted, the cloth which gives m&#257;ttu is one belonging to
the washerwoman, not to the person to be purified. The washerwoman
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>gives her own cloth to effect the purification.
Theoretically, the Tiyan has the power to give or withhold m&#257;ttu,
and thus keep any one out of caste in a state of impurity; but it is a
privilege which is seldom if ever exercised. Yet it is one which he
admittedly holds, and is thus in a position to exercise considerable
control over the Namb&#363;tiri and N&#257;yar communities. It is odd
that it is not a soiled cloth washed and returned to the person which
gives purification, but one of the washerwoman&rsquo;s own cloths. So
the m&#257;ttu may have a deeper meaning than lies in mere change of
cloth, dressing in a clean one, and giving the soiled one to a person
of inferior caste to wash. This m&#257;ttu is second in importance to
no custom. It must be done on the last day of pollution after birth and
death ceremonies, and menstruation, or the person concerned remains
outcasted. It is noteworthy that the Izhuvans know nothing of
m&#257;ttu.</p>
<p>An Izhuvan will eat rice cooked by a Tiyan, but a Tiyan will not eat
rice cooked by an Izhuvan&mdash;a circumstance pointing to the
inferiority of the Izhuvan. A N&#257;yar, as well as a Tiyan, will
partake of almost any form of food or drink, which is prepared even by
a M&#257;ppilla (Malabar Muhammadan), who is deemed inferior to both.
But the line is drawn at rice, which must be prepared by one of equal
caste or class, or by a superior. An Izhuvan, partaking of rice at a
Tiyan&rsquo;s house, must eat it in a verandah; he cannot do so in the
house, as that would be defilement to the Tiyan. Not only must the
Izhuvan eat the rice in the verandah, but he must wash the plates, and
clean up the place where he has eaten. Again, an Izhuvan could have no
objection to drinking from a Tiyan&rsquo;s well. Further, there is
practically no mixture in the distribution of Tiyans and Izhuvans.
Where there are Izhuvans there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41"
href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>are no Tiyans, and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>. [In a photograph of a group of Izhuvan females of
Palghat eating their meal, which was sent to me, they are all in a
kneeling posture, with the buttocks supported on the heels. They are
said to assume the same attitude when engaged in grinding and winnowing
grain, and other occupations, with a resultant thickening of the skin
over the knees.]</p>
<p>Differences, which might well come under the heading marriage, may
be considered here, for the purpose of comparison between the Tiyans
and Izhuvans. During the preliminaries to the marriage ceremony among
the Tiyans, the date of the marriage having been fixed in the presence
of the representatives of the bride and bridegroom, the following
formula is repeated by the Tand&#257;n or headman of the bride&rsquo;s
party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. &ldquo;The
tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted; the
astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and
porutham; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations,
the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the
eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams); the
conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been
performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of
... the son of ... with ... daughter of ... in the presence of
muperium.&rdquo; This formula, with slight variations here and there,
is repeated at every Tiyan marriage in South Malabar. It is a solemn
declaration, giving validity to the union, although, in the way that
custom and ritual survive long after their original significance has
been forgotten, the meaning of many of the terms used is altogether
unknown. What, for instance, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>is the meaning of muperium? No one
can tell. But a few of the terms are explainable.</p>
<p>Tara. The tara was the smallest unit in the ancient government
system, which, for want of a better term, we may style feudal. It was
not exactly a village, for the people lived apart. Each tara had its
N&#257;yar chieftain, and also its Tiyan chief or Tand&#257;n, its
astrologer, its washerman, its goldsmith, and other useful people, each
serving the community for the sake of small advantages. Each tara was
its own world.</p>
<p>Changati (friend). The friends of both parties which negotiated the
marriage.</p>
<p>Porutham (agreement). Examination of the horoscopes of the boy and
girl makes it possible to ascertain whether there is agreement between
the two, and the union will be propitious.</p>
<p>Illam. Here intended to mean the father&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Kulam. The name, derived from kula a branch, here denotes the
mother&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Twelve illams, ten kiriyams. The word illam, now used exclusively
for the residence of a Namb&#363;tiri, is supposed to have been used in
days of old for the house of a person of any caste. And this
supposition is said to find support in the way that a Tiyan coming from
the south is often greeted in South Canara. Thus, a Malabar Tiyan,
travelling to the celebrated temple at Gokarnam in South Canara, is at
once asked &ldquo;What is your illam and kiriyam?&rdquo; He has heard
these terms used in the foregoing formula during his own or
another&rsquo;s marriage ceremony, but attached no meaning to them. To
the man of South Canara they have genuine meaning. One should be able
to answer the question satisfactorily, and thus give a proper account
of himself. If he cannot, he gets neither food nor water from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>South Canara Tiyan. This also holds good, to some
extent, in the case of a southern Tiyan visiting the northern parts of
the Cherakal t&#257;luk of Malabar.</p>

</div>
<p>The illams of North Malabar are said to be&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nellika.</li>
<li>Pullanhi.</li>
<li>Vangeri.</li>
<li>Koyikkalan.</li>
<li>Padayam Kudi.</li>
<li>Tenan Kudi.</li>
<li>Manan Kudi.</li>
<li>Vilakkan Kudi.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the
same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams.
In fact, the illams are exogamous. Members of some of the illams were
allowed certain privileges and dignities. Thus, the men of the Varakat
illam (Varaka Tiyans) were in the old days permitted to travel in a
mancheel (a hammock-cot slung on a pole). They were allowed this
privilege of higher caste people, which was prohibited to the Tiyans of
other illams. But, should one of them, when travelling in a mancheel,
happen to see a R&#257;jah or a N&#257;yar, he was obliged to hang one
of his legs out of it in token of submission. The Varaka Tiyans were
further allowed to wear gold jewels on the neck, to don silken cloths,
to fasten a sword round the waist, and to carry a shield. The sword was
made of thin pliable steel, and worn round the waist like a belt, the
point being fastened to the hilt through a small hole near the point. A
man, intending to damage another, might make an apparently <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>friendly
call on him, his body loosely covered with a cloth, and to all
appearances unarmed. In less than a second, he could unfasten the sword
round his waist, and cut the other down. The well-known Mannanar
belonged to the Varakat illam. Those who know Malabar will recall to
mind the benevolent but strange institution which he initiated. He
provided a comfortable home for Namb&#363;tiri women who were thrown
out of caste, and thus in the ordinary course of events doomed to every
misery and degradation to be found in life. On being outcasted, the
funeral ceremonies of Namb&#363;tiri women were performed by her own
people, and she became dead to them. She went to the Mannanar, and her
birth ceremonies were performed, so that she might begin life anew in a
state of purity. If, on arrival, she entered by the left door, she was
his wife, if by the front door, his sister. It is said that, when their
chief, Mannanar of the Aramana, is destitute of heirs, the Tiyans of
Kolattan&#257;d go in procession to the Kurumatt&#363;r Namb&#363;tiri
(the chief of the Peringall&#363;r Br&#257;hmans) and demand a
Br&#257;hman virgin to be adopted as sister of Mannanar, who follows
the marumakkat&#257;yam rule of succession. This demand, it is said,
used to be granted by the Namb&#363;tiris assembling at a meeting, and
selecting a maiden to be given to the Tiyans.</p>
<p>Kiriyam is said to be a corrupt form of the Sanskrit word griham
(house), but this seems rather fanciful. There are said to have been
about two kiriyams for each village. The names of only three are known
to me, viz., Karumana, Kaita, and Kampathi. There is a village called
Karumana, near the temple of Lakshmipuram in South Canara. Karumana is
applied as a term to signify a Tiyan during the ordinary devil-dancing
in temples, when an oracular utterance is delivered. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>oracle
always addresses the Tiyan as &ldquo;my Karumana,<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1468" title="Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span> not as &ldquo;my
Tiyan.&rdquo; The only other use of the word is in Karumana acharam
(the customs of the Tiyans).</p>
<p>Other outward and visible differences between Tiyan and Izhuvan
marriages are these. The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if
for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins,
carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly
equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword
under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a
singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-p&#257;ttu, or open the door
song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the
bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is
supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different
colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit
him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other
lady. He beseeches; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields.
The song is more or less extempore, and each side must be ready with an
immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having
no answer is beaten and under ignominy.</p>
<p>I pass on to the subject of personal adornment of the
Tiyans:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) North Malabar, Males&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. A horizontal dab made with white ashes on either side of the
forehead and chest, and on the outside of each shoulder.</li>
<li>2. Two gold ear-rings (kadakkan) in each ear. A silver chain
hanging from the sheath of his knife, and fastened with a boss. Two
tambak (copper, brass and silver) rings on the ring finger of the left
hand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span></li>
<li>3. A gold kadakkan in each ear, and an iron ring on the ring finger
of the left hand.</li>
<li>4. A thorn in each ear (another was similarly ornamented). Not
married.</li>
<li>5. A gold ear-ring in each ear. An iron ring on the little finger
of the left hand. Two silver rings, in which is set a piece of hair
from an elephant&rsquo;s tail, on the little finger of the right
hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few individuals wore brass rings, and some had ear-rings, in which
a red stone was set. Amulets were worn by some in little cylindrical
cases on a string, to protect the wearer against enemies, the evil eye,
or devils. One man wore a silver girdle, to which an amulet in a case
was fastened, underneath his cloth, so that it was not in view to the
public. One individual only is noted as having been tattooed, with a
circular mark just above his glabella. The arms of a good many, and the
abdomen of a few, bore cicatrices from branding, apparently for the
purpose of making them strong and relieving pains.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) South Malabar, Males.</p>
<p>In the country parts, the waist cloth is always worn above the knee.
About a third of the individuals examined wore ear-rings. The ears of
all were pierced. Those who were without ear-rings had no scruples
about wearing them, but were too poor to buy them.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Blue spot tattooed over the glabella.</li>
<li>2. Silver amulet-case, containing fifteen gold fanams, at the
waist. He said that he kept the coins in the receptacle for security,
but I think it was for good luck.</li>
<li>3. Ear-ring (kadakkan) in each ear. A copper amulet-case,
containing a yantram to keep off devils, at the waist. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span></li>
<li>4. Four silver amulet-cases, containing yantrams on a copper sheet
for curing some ailment, at the waist.</li>
<li>5. Two gold kadakkans in each ear. A white spot over the
glabella.</li>
</ul>
<p>(<i>c</i>) North Malabar, Females.</p>
<p>In olden days, the women used to wear coloured and striped cloths
round the waist, and hanging to the knees. The breast was not covered.
The body above the waist was not allowed to be covered, except during
the period of death pollution. Nowadays, white is generally the colour
to be seen, and the body is seldom covered above the waist&mdash;never
one may say, except (and then only sometimes) in the towns. The Izhuvan
women in Malabar always wear blue cloths: just one cloth rolled tightly
round the waist, and hanging to the knees. Of late, they have taken to
wearing also a blue cloth drawn tight over the breast.</p>
<p>Ornaments. The th&#333;du, which is now sometimes worn by Tiyan
women, is not a Tiyan ornament. The ear-rings, called kathila and
ananthod, are the Tiyan ornaments, and look like strings of gold beads
with pendants. Discs of white metal or lead are used to stretch and
keep open the dilated lobes of the ears, in which gold ornaments are
worn when necessary or possible. Venetian sequins, real or imitation,
known in Malabar as am&#257;da, are largely used for neck ornaments.
There is a Malabar proverb that one need not look for an insect&rsquo;s
burrow in am&#257;da, meaning that you cannot find anything vile in a
worthy person.</p>
<p>Turning now to the subject of marriage. In the ordinary course of
things, a marriage would not be made between a Tiyan girl of South
Malabar and a Tiyan man of North Malabar, for the reason that the
children <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>of such a marriage would inherit no property from
the family of either parent. The husband would have no share in the
property of his family, which devolves through the women; nor would the
wife have any share in that of her family, which is passed on through
the men. So there would be nothing for the children. But, on the other
hand, marriage between a girl of the north and a man of the south is a
different thing. The children would inherit from both parents. As a
rule, Tiyans of the north marry in the north, and those of the south in
the south.</p>
<p>It was generally admitted that it was formerly the custom among the
Tiyans in South Malabar for several brothers&mdash;in fact all of
them&mdash;to share one wife. Two existing instances of this custom
were recorded.</p>
<p>The arrangement of a marriage, and the ceremonial which will now be
described, though pertaining strictly to the Calicut t&#257;luk of
South Malabar, are sufficiently representative of a Tiyan marriage
anywhere. There is, however, this difference, that, in North Malabar,
where inheritance through females obtains, and the wife invariably
resides in her own tarwad or family home, there is never any
stipulation concerning a girl&rsquo;s dowry. In South Malabar, where
inheritance is through the males, and where the wife lives in her
husband&rsquo;s house, the dowry in money, jewels, or furniture, is as
a rule settled beforehand, and must be handed over on the wedding day.
In the Calicut t&#257;luk, we find an exception to this general rule of
South Malabar, where the subject of the dowry is not usually mentioned.
In North Malabar, gifts of jewels are made in proportion as the
bride&rsquo;s people are wealthy and generous. What is given is in the
way of a gift, and forms no feature in the marital agreement.</p>

<p>The first step to be taken in connection with marriage is
examination of the horoscopes of the boy and girl, in order to
ascertain whether their union will be one of happiness or the reverse.
While this is being done by the Panikkar (Malabar astrologer), the
following persons should be present:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) On the part of the bridegroom&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Tand&#257;n, or chief of the tara.</li>
<li>2. Father, or other elder in the family.</li>
<li>3. Uncle, <i>i.e.</i>, the mother&rsquo;s brother. In Malabar the
word uncle means maternal uncle.</li>
<li>4. Sisters&rsquo; husbands.</li>
<li>5. Four or more friends or companions.</li>
<li>6. Any number of relations and friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>(<i>b</i>) On the part of the bride&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Tand&#257;n of her tara.</li>
<li>2. Father,or other guardian.</li>
<li>3. Uncle.</li>
<li>4. Four or more friends.</li>
<li>5. The astrologer of her tara.</li>
<li>6. Friends and relations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ceremony must be performed at the house of the girl&rsquo;s
family. Her father&rsquo;s consent is necessary, but his presence is
not essential at this or the two subsequent ceremonies in connection
with the marriage. The Tand&#257;n, it may be noted, is the caste
governmental head in all matters affecting his own caste and the
artisans. He is a Tiyan, and his office, which is authorised by the
local R&#257;jah, or rather by his senior R&#257;ni, is hereditary. In
exceptional cases, however, the hereditary right may be interrupted by
the R&#257;ni appointing some one else. The Tand&#257;n of the tara is
required to assist at every ceremony connected with marriage, at the
ceremony when a girl attains puberty, at that of tying the t&#257;li,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>at the fifth and seventh months of pregnancy. His
formal permission is required before the carpenter can cut down the
areca palm, with which the little shed in which the t&#257;li is tied
is constructed. In cases of divorce, his functions are important. When
a new house is built, there must be a house-warming ceremony, at which
the Tand&#257;n officiates. Fowls are sacrificed, and the right leg is
the Tand&#257;n&rsquo;s perquisite. He is a man of importance, not only
in many affairs within his own caste, but also in those of other
castes. Thus, when a N&#257;yar dies, it is the Tand&#257;n&rsquo;s
duty to get the body burnt. He controls the washerman and barber of the
tara, and can withdraw their services when they are most needed. He
officiates, moreover, at marriages of the artisan
class&mdash;carpenters, braziers, goldsmiths and blacksmiths.</p>
<p>A group of taras forms what is called a d&#275;sam, the koyma or
&ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo; of which is represented by a N&#257;yar
tarwad. It is through the head or Karnavan (really the chieftain) of
this tarwad that the Tand&#257;n approaches the R&#257;ja in matters of
appeal, and the like. The Tand&#257;n is to some extent under his
guidance and control, but he must provide the Tand&#257;n with a
body-guard of two N&#257;yars on occasions of marriages. In the old
days, it may be mentioned, the Tand&#257;ns of the taras within the
rule of the Zamorin were always appointed by his senior R&#257;ni. The
term Tand&#257;n must not be confounded with the Tandars, a people of
the Palgh&#257;t t&#257;luk, who appear to be allied to the Izhuvans.
These Tandars observe the custom of paternal polyandry, while the
Izhuvans abhor it.</p>
<p>The procedure observed in the examination of horoscopes is as
follows. The Tand&#257;n of the bride&rsquo;s tara gives a grass or
palmyra palm leaf mat to the astrologer <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>to sit on, and supplies
mats or seats for the bridegroom&rsquo;s party. The common sleeping mat
of wild pine leaves, or a wooden stool, must, on no account, be given
for the astrologer to sit on. It may be day or night when the ceremony
takes place, but, whatever the hour may be, a lamp having five, seven,
nine, or eleven cotton wicks, must be burning in front of the
astrologer. The Tand&#257;n&rsquo;s wife puts it in its place. Then the
boy&rsquo;s uncle hands over the boy&rsquo;s horoscope to his
Tand&#257;n, who passes it on to the girl&rsquo;s Tand&#257;n. The
girl&rsquo;s father hands her horoscope to their Tand&#257;n, who, when
he has received them both, passes them on to the astrologer. The two
horoscopes should agree on twenty-one points&mdash;a requirement which
might prove awkward, were it not that a balance in favour of beneficent
influences is generally allowed to admit of the marriage taking place.
In the case of agreement, the boy&rsquo;s uncle, through his
Tand&#257;n, then pays two fanams<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1592src"
href="#xd21e1592" name="xd21e1592src">20</a> (eight annas)&mdash;one
for each horoscope&mdash;to the astrologer. When there is disagreement,
the girl&rsquo;s uncle pays the money. The horoscopes (which have been
privately examined beforehand to make sure of no disagreement) are
returned to their respective owners. After the examination of the
horoscope, there is a feast with plenty of sweetmeats. The next item is
the conjee (rice gruel) ceremony, at which the following should be
present:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) On the part of the boy&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Father, his brother, or some one representing him.</li>
<li>2. Husbands of all married sisters.</li>
<li>3. Uncle.</li>
<li>4. Tand&#257;n of his tara.</li>
<li>5. Neighbours and friends.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) On the part of the girl&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Uncle.</li>
<li>2. Relations of married sisters.</li>
<li>3. Relations of married brothers.</li>
<li>4. Tand&#257;n of her tara.</li>
<li>5. Astrologer of her tara.</li>
<li>6. Relations and friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>The horoscopes are again formally examined by the astrologer, who
announces that their agreement augurs a happy wedded life. The
boy&rsquo;s uncle pays him two fanams. The girl&rsquo;s uncle takes the
two horoscopes, which have just been tied together, from the
astrologer, and hands them to the Tand&#257;n of the girl&rsquo;s tara,
who passes them on to the Tand&#257;n of the boy&rsquo;s tara. They are
handed by him to the boy&rsquo;s uncle. The astrologer then writes on a
palmyra leaf a note for each party to the marriage, stating the
auspicious day and hour for the final ceremony, the hour at which the
bride should leave her house, and the hour for her arrival at the house
of the bridegroom. The following programme is then gone through. In the
verandah, facing east, before the front door, is spread an ordinary
sleeping mat, over it a grass mat, and over that a plain white cloth
which has been washed and is not a new one. On the floor close by, the
following articles are placed:&mdash;</p>
<p>A lamp, having an odd number of cotton wicks, which is kept lighted
whatever the hour of day it may be;</p>
<p>A measure, called n&#257;zhi, made of jak tree (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Artocarpus integrifolia</i>) wood, filled to overflowing
with rice, and placed on a flat bell-metal plate (talika);</p>
<p>A plain white cloth, washed but not new, neatly folded, and placed
on the metal plate to the right (south) of the rice; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>A small bell-metal vessel (kindi), having no handle, filled with
water.</p>
<p>The lamp is placed on the south side of the mat, the plate next to
it (to the north), and the kindi at a little distance to the left (the
north). The people who sit on the mat always face the east. The mat
having been spread, the various articles just mentioned are brought
from the central room of the house by three women, who set them in
their places. The Tand&#257;n&rsquo;s wife carries the lamp, the eldest
woman of the house the bell-metal plate, and some other woman the
kindi. The Tand&#257;n of the boy&rsquo;s tara, the boy&rsquo;s
sister&rsquo;s husband, and a friend then sit on the mat covered with a
cloth. If the boy has two brothers-in-law, both sit on the mat, to the
exclusion of the friend. The senior woman of the house then hands three
plates of rice conjee to the Tand&#257;n of the girl&rsquo;s tara, who
places them in front of the three persons seated on the mat. To the
right of each plate, a little jaggery (unrefined sugar) is placed on a
piece of plantain leaf. Each of those seated takes about a spoonful of
conjee in his right hand. The Tand&#257;n repeats the formula, which
has already been given, and asks &ldquo;May the conjee be drunk&rdquo;?
He answers his question by drinking some of the conjee, and eating a
little jaggery. All three then partake of the conjee and jaggery, after
which they rise from the mat, and the plates and mat are removed. The
place is cleaned, and the mats are again put down, while betel is
distributed. The two Tand&#257;ns then sit on the mat. The girl&rsquo;s
Tand&#257;n picks up a bundle of about twenty-five betel leaves, and
gives half to the boy&rsquo;s Tand&#257;n. The Tand&#257;ns exchange
betel leaves, each giving the other four. The boy&rsquo;s Tand&#257;n
then folds four fanams (one rupee) in four betel leaves, which he hands
to the girl&rsquo;s Tand&#257;n, saying &ldquo;May the conjee ceremony
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>be performed&rdquo;? The Tand&#257;ns again
exchange betel leaves as before, and distribute them to all the
castemen present, beginning with the uncles of the boy and girl. The
proceedings in the verandah are now over. The next part of the ceremony
takes place in the middle room of the house, where the mats, lamp, and
other articles are arranged as before. The two Tand&#257;ns sit on the
mat with the boy on the right and the girl on the left, facing east.
The boy&rsquo;s uncle stands in front of the Tand&#257;ns, facing west,
and the girl&rsquo;s uncle behind them, facing east. The boy&rsquo;s
father gives to the boy&rsquo;s uncle two new plain white cloths, with
twenty-one fanams (Rs. 5&ndash;4) placed on them. When presenting them,
he says &ldquo;Let the Adayalam be performed&rdquo; three times, and
the girl&rsquo;s uncle says thrice &ldquo;Let me receive the
Adayalam.&rdquo; The Tand&#257;ns again exchange betel leaves, and
distribute them among the castemen. Then follows a feast, and more
betel. The date of the wedding has now to be fixed. They congregate in
the middle room once more, and the Tand&#257;ns sit on the mat. The
girl&rsquo;s Tand&#257;n shares a bundle of betel leaves with the
boy&rsquo;s Tand&#257;n, who, taking therefrom four leaves, places two
rupees on them, and gives them to the girl&rsquo;s Tand&#257;n. The
boy&rsquo;s party supplies this money, which is a perquisite of the
Tand&#257;n. When handing over the leaves and the coins, the
boy&rsquo;s Tandan says &ldquo;On ... (naming a date) ... and ... (the
bride and bridegroom), and friends, and four women will come. Then you
must give us the girl, and you must prepare the food for that
day.&rdquo; The other Tand&#257;n replies &ldquo;If you bring six
cloths and forty-two fanams (Rs. 10&ndash;8) as kanam, and two fanams
for the muchenan (the girl&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son),
the girl will be sent to you.&rdquo; The cloths should be of a kind
called enna kacha, each four cubits in length, but they are not now
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>procurable. Kanam is a term used in land tenures,
for which there is no precise equivalent in English. It is a kind of
mortgage paid by a tenant to a landlord. The former is liable to
eviction by the latter, when he obtains better terms for his land from
another tenant&mdash;a condition of modern growth breeding much
mischief and bad blood. But, when a tenant is evicted, he is entitled,
according to law, to the value of certain improvements on the land,
including eight annas for each tree which he has planted. The kanam is
paid by the boy&rsquo;s sister or sisters. His Tand&#257;n addresses
his brother-in-law or brothers-in-law in the words &ldquo;On ...
(mentioning a date), you must come early in the day, with Rs.
10&ndash;8 as kanam,&rdquo; and gives him or them four betel leaves.
Those assembled then disperse. The boy&rsquo;s people may not go to the
girl&rsquo;s house before the day appointed for the marriage.</p>
<p>The next item in connection with a marriage is the issue of
invitations to the wedding. The senior women of the boy&rsquo;s house,
and the Tand&#257;n, invite a few friends to assemble at the house of
the bridegroom. The mat, lamp, and other articles are placed in the
middle room. The bridegroom (manav&#257;lan) sits on the mat, with a
friend on either side of him. He has previously bathed, and horizontal
daubs of sandal paste have been placed on his forehead, breast, and
arms. He wears a new cloth, which has not been washed. His Tand&#257;n
has adorned him with a gold bracelet on his right wrist, a knife with a
gold or silver handle at the waist, and a gold or silver waist-belt or
girdle over the loin-cloth. The bracelet must have an ornamental
pattern, as plain bracelets are not worn by men. The girdle is in the
form of a chain. Besides these things, he must wear ear-rings, and he
should have rings on his fingers. His sister who pays <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>the
kanam dresses in the same style, but her cloths may be of silk, white
without a pattern in the border, and she wears gold bracelets on both
wrists. All enjoy a good meal, and then set out, and visit first the
house of the Tand&#257;n. He and his wife walk in front, followed by
the boy&rsquo;s elder sisters, if he has any. Then comes the bridegroom
with a friend before and behind him, with a few women bringing up the
rear. At the Tand&#257;n&rsquo;s house there is another meal, and then
three, five, or seven houses are visited, and invitation to the wedding
given in person. The proceedings for the day are then over, and, after
three days, the brother-in-law, uncle, and all others receive
invitations.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the marriage ceremony, the barber first shaves
the bridegroom&rsquo;s head, leaving the usual forelock on the crown,
which is never cut. He performs the operation in a little shed to the
east of the house, and a plantain leaf is placed so that the hair may
fall on it. As a rule, the barber sits in front of the person whose
hair he is shaving, while the latter, sitting cross-legged on the
ground, bends forward. But, on this occasion, the bridegroom sits on a
low wooden stool. Close by are a lamp and a measure of rice on a
plantain leaf. The barber also shaves the two friends of the bridegroom
(changathis), and receives a fanam and the rice for his trouble. The
three youths then bathe, smear themselves with sandal paste, and
proceed to dress. The bridegroom must wear round the loins a white
cloth, new and unwashed. Round the top of the loin cloth he wears a
narrow waist-band (kacha) of silk, from 14 to 21 cubits in length, with
the ends hanging in front and behind. Over the shoulders is thrown a
silk lace handkerchief. He puts in his ears gold ear-rings, round the
neck a necklace called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57"
name="pb57">57</a>]</span>chakra (wheel) mala,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1661src" href="#xd21e1661" name="xd21e1661src">21</a> on the
right wrist a gold bracelet, gold rings on the fingers, a gold or
silver chain round the loins, and a gold or silver-handled knife with a
sheath of the same metal. The two companions are dressed in much the
same way, but they wear neither necklace nor bracelet. The women wear
as many ornaments as they please. Sisters of the bridegroom must wear
bracelets on both wrists, a necklace, and a silk cloth (vir&#257;li) on
the shoulders. The bracelet worn by men is called vala, and must be
made of one piece of metal. Those worn by women are called kadakam, and
must be made in two pieces. When all are ready, mats, and other things
are once more placed in the middle room, and the bridegroom and his two
companions sit on the mats. They at once rise, and proceed to the
little shed which has been erected in the front yard, and again seat
themselves on the mats, which, with the other articles, have been
brought thither from the middle room. Then the Tand&#257;n gives betel
to the bridegroom and his two companions, who must chew it. The
Tand&#257;n&rsquo;s wife, the elder woman of the house, and the
bridegroom&rsquo;s sisters sprinkle rice on their heads. The
Tand&#257;n gives a sword to the bridegroom and each of his companions.
The procession then starts. In front walk two N&#257;yars supplied by
the Koyma of the d&#275;sam (represented by the N&#257;yar landlord).
Then come the Tand&#257;n and a few elders, followed by the
Tand&#257;n&rsquo;s wife and some of the elder women, the bridegroom
with his two companions, his sisters, and finally the general crowd. As
the procession moves slowly on, there is much dancing, and swinging of
swords and shields. At the bride&rsquo;s house, the party is received
by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>the wife of the Tand&#257;n of the tara holding a
lighted lamp, the oldest woman of the family with a plate containing a
measure of rice and a folded cloth, and another woman, who may be a
friend, with a kindi of water. They sprinkle a little rice on the heads
of the party as they enter the yard. The bridegroom sits on a mat,
close to which the lamp and other articles are set. The bride&rsquo;s
Tand&#257;n takes charge of the swords, betel is distributed, and a
hearty meal partaken of. The six cloths, which the bridegroom is
required to bring are in reality three double cloths, one of which is
for the use of the bride. It is the privilege of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
sisters and the Tand&#257;n&rsquo;s wife to dress her. Her waist-cloth
is tied in a peculiar way for the occasion, and she is enveloped from
head to foot in a silken cloth, leaving only the eyes visible. The
bridegroom, after his arrival at the bride&rsquo;s house, has to put on
a peculiar turban of conical shape, made of a stiff towel-like
material, tied round with a silk handkerchief. The bridegroom&rsquo;s
sister leads the bride to the little shed (pandal) in the yard, and
seats her behind the bridegroom. The kanam, and the remaining four
cloths are then given by the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister to the
bride&rsquo;s mother, and they, having tied a silk handkerchief across
the body like a Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s thread, stand behind the
bridegroom, the mother to the right and the sister to the left. The
latter says three times &ldquo;Let the kanam be given,&rdquo; and hands
it to the bride&rsquo;s mother, who, as she receives it, says thrice
&ldquo;Let me receive the kanam.&rdquo; The mother at once hands it
over to her husband, or the senior male member of the family. The
Tand&#257;n then places plantain leaves, for use as plates, before the
bridegroom and his two companions, and, facing the bridegroom, holds a
vessel of cooked rice in front of him. The bride&rsquo;s mother,
standing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>behind him, serves out thrice some rice out of the
pot on to the leaf in front of the bridegroom, and the Tand&#257;n does
the same for his two companions. The bride&rsquo;s mother then mixes
some plantains, pappadams (large thin biscuits), sugar, and gh&#299;
(clarified butter) with the rice on the bridegroom&rsquo;s leaf-plate,
and offers the food to him three times. She will not, however, allow
him to taste it. It is taken from his lips, and removed by the
washerwomen. The bridegroom&rsquo;s sister has the same play with the
bride. The rice, which has thus been made a feature of the ceremony, is
called ayini. A few days prior to the marriage, two small bundles of
betel leaves, each containing areca nuts, half a dozen tobacco leaves,
and two fanams are given by the bridegroom to the N&#257;yar chieftain
of the d&#275;sam as his fee for furnishing an escort. In return for
these offerings, he gives a new cloth to the bridegroom. Three measures
of raw rice, ten or twelve pappadams, plantains, a cocoanut, and some
dry uncooked curry-stuff are given by the bridegroom to each of the
N&#257;yars provided as escort on the eve of the marriage. When they
arrive on the scene on the wedding day, they are given some beaten
rice, rice cakes, cocoanuts, plantains, and a drink of arrack (spirit).
When the bride&rsquo;s parents and relations come for the Vathil
ceremony, the same escort is provided, and the same presents are given.
Just as the bridegroom and all are ready to leave, the bride&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son called the machunan, steps forward,
and demands two fanams from the bridegroom&rsquo;s party in return for
permission to take away the bride. He gets his money, and the party
starts for the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, after rice has been sprinkled
over the heads of the contracting couple, the sisters of the bridegroom
leading the bride. The swords, which have been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>returned
by the Tand&#257;n, are again used in flourishing and dancing <i>en
route</i>.</p>
<p>It is a prevalent custom throughout Southern India that a
girl&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son has the first right to
her hand in marriage. This obtains not only among the Dravidian
peoples, but also among Br&#257;hmans. The Malay&#257;lam word for
son-in-law (marumakan) means nephew. If a stranger should marry a girl,
he also is called nephew. But the unmarried nephew, having the first
admitted right to the girl, must be paid eight annas, or two fanams,
before he will allow her to be taken away. The argument is said to be
as follows. A sister pays forty-two fanams as kanam for her
brother&rsquo;s wife. When the product, <i>i.e.</i>, a daughter, is
transferred to a stranger, the son claims compensation on his
mother&rsquo;s investment at the same rate as that at which a cocoanut
tree is valued&mdash;eight annas. At all events, the nephew has the
first right to a girl, and must be compensated before she can be taken
away by another.</p>
<p>At the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, the party is received by the wife
of the Tand&#257;n and the lady of the house. Following the bride
should come her parents and other relations, two N&#257;yars
representing the chieftain, and the Tand&#257;n of his tara. The
formalities with mats and rice are gone through as before. Rice is
sprinkled over the heads, the Tand&#257;n receives the swords, and all
sit in the shed. The ayini rice ceremony is repeated for the bride by
the bridegroom&rsquo;s mother and sisters. The happy pair then proceed
to the inner room of the house, where sweetmeats are served to them.
Then is observed, as a rule, the asaram or gift ceremony. Relations are
expected to give 101 fanams (Rs. 25&ndash;4), but the poorest of them
are allowed to reduce the gift to 21 fanams (Rs. 5&ndash;4), and the
others give according to their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61"
href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>means. These gifts are supposed
to be repaid with interest. The Tand&#257;n sees that a regular account
of all the gifts is made out, and handed over to the bridegroom, and
receives eight annas for his trouble. The accountant who prepares the
accounts, and the person who tests the genuineness of the coins, each
receives a bundle of betel leaves, four areca nuts, and two tobacco
leaves. Betel leaves, areca nuts, and tobacco, are also given to each
giver of gifts. After this, there is the vatil or house ceremony. Two
large bundles of betel leaves are prepared, each of which contains a
thousand or fifteen hundred leaves, and with them are placed forty or
fifty tobacco leaves, and seventy to a hundred areca nuts. The
bride&rsquo;s Tand&#257;n pays two or four rupees as vatil kanam to the
Tand&#257;n of the bridegroom, who hands the money to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s father. The bridegroom then places one bundle of
betel leaves, with half the tobacco and areca nuts, before the
bride&rsquo;s father, and the other before her mother, and they are
distributed by the Tand&#257;n of the girl&rsquo;s tara and his wife
among the men and women who are present. Sweetmeats are then
distributed, and the marriage ceremony is concluded. A formal visit
must be made subsequently by the women of the bride&rsquo;s house to
the bridegroom&rsquo;s, and is returned by the bride and bridegroom.
The first visit is paid by a party consisting of the bride&rsquo;s
mother, her uncle&rsquo;s and brother&rsquo;s wives, the wife of the
Tand&#257;n, and other relations. They are expected to bring with them
plenty of sweetmeats and bread for general distribution. When the
return visit is made by the bride and bridegroom, the sister of the
latter, and other relations and friends, should accompany them, and
they should take with them a lot of betel leaves, areca nuts, tobacco,
and sweetmeats. This exchange of visits does not, however, complete
those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>which are <i lang="fr">de rigueur</i>. For, at the
next &#332;nam and Vishu festivals, the newly married couple should
visit the house of the bride&rsquo;s family. &#332;nam is the beginning
of the first harvest, and Vishu the agricultural new year. On these
occasions, the bridegroom takes with him the inevitable betel leaves,
and presents a new cloth to the parents of the bride and every one else
in the house. When the annual Tiruvathira festival takes place between
the betrothal and marriage ceremonies, the bridegroom is expected to
send to the temple, through his Tand&#257;n and one of his own
relations, a quantity of ripe and unripe plantains.</p>
<p>The ceremonies which have been described differ considerably from
those of the Tiyans of North Malabar, where the marumakkat&#257;yam law
of inheritance obtains. These are very simple affairs.</p>
<p>In the Calicut t&#257;luk, a man can marry only one wife at a time.
But, when a wife is barren, a leper, or suffering from incurable
disease, her husband may, with her formal permission, marry another
wife. A bride may be of any age. Where there is no stipulation as to
dowry, it is a point of honour to give the girl as many jewels as the
bridegroom can afford. Widows may remarry.</p>
<p>Divorce is admissible, when the grounds for it are sufficient. And,
when we find that incompatibility of temper is among these, it is safe
to say that it is fairly easy of accomplishment. No specific reason
need, in fact, be assigned. When it is the man who wishes to get rid of
his wife, he must pay her all her expenses towards the marriage, as
assessed by persons of the caste who fill the r&ocirc;le of mediators.
He has to give up jewels received from his wife&rsquo;s family, and
must, in some cases, pay the discarded wife something on account of her
loss of virginity&mdash;a circumstance, which might make <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>it
difficult for her to obtain another husband. If the wife wishes to get
rid of her husband, she must pay up all his expenses towards the
marriage. The party found to be in the wrong must pay a fee of five to
twenty rupees to the Tand&#257;n and all present, the relations
excepted. The amount is distributed then and there. The procedure to be
adopted in effecting divorce is as follows. The Tand&#257;ns of both
sides, uncles and relations, and sometimes the fathers, assemble at the
house of the wife, the Tand&#257;n, or one of the relations. To the
left of a burning lamp are placed two small wooden stools. On one of
these are laid a small towel with four fanams (one rupee) tied up in a
corner of it, and another towel with a little rice and four fanams tied
up in it. Close by is the other stool, on which the wife&rsquo;s uncle
stretches a single thread taken from his own cloth. The husband carries
this stool to the gate, and says three times to the wife&rsquo;s
brother, father, or uncle&mdash;&ldquo;Your sister&rsquo;s
(daughter&rsquo;s or niece&rsquo;s) matrimonial connection is
severed.&rdquo; He then blows away the thread, throws the stool down,
and departs for ever. This little ceremony cannot be performed at the
husband&rsquo;s house, as it would involve perpetual banishment from
his own house. The coins in the cloths go to the Tand&#257;ns. It is
the uncle who gives these cloths, because it was he who received the
two cloths at the conjee ceremony. A marriage cannot be dissolved
unless both parties agree.</p>

<p>A girl is under pollution for four days from the commencement of the
first menstrual period. During this time she must keep to the north
side of the house, where she sleeps on a grass mat of a particular
kind, in a room festooned with garlands of young cocoanut leaves. Round
the mat is a narrow ridge made of paddy (unhusked rice), rice, and
flowers of the cocoanut and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>areca palms. A lamp is kept burning,
near which are placed the various articles already described in
connection with marriage. Another girl keeps her company and sleeps
with her, but she must not touch any other person, tree or plant. She
further must not see the sky, and woe betide her if she catches sight
of a crow or cat. Her diet must be strictly vegetarian, without salt,
tamarinds, or chillies. She is armed against evil spirits with an iron
knife carried on her person, or placed on the mat. On the first day,
she is seated on a wooden stool in the yard to the east of the house.
The fresh spathe of a cocoanut is cut in front of her. The bunch of
blossoms is placed in a copper pot painted with perpendicular lines of
chunam (lime), and a horizontal line at the top and bottom. The spathe
of an areca palm is similarly treated, and, if the contents of both
spathes are plentiful, it is regarded as a good augury of fertility.
The wife of the girl&rsquo;s uncle, or, if she is married, her
husband&rsquo;s sister pours some gingelly (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Sesamum</i>) oil over her head, on the top of which a gold
fanam has been placed. Failing such relations, the wife of the
Tand&#257;n officiates. The operation is repeated by two other women,
relatives if possible. The oil is poured from a little cup made from a
leaf of the j&#257;k tree (<i lang="la-x-bio">Artocarpus
integrifolia</i>), flows over the forehead, and is received with the
fanam in a dish. It is a good omen if the coin falls with the obverse
upwards. Rice is cooked with jaggery, and given to the girl. The other
women partake thereof, and then have a feast by themselves. The
anointing with oil is the only bath the girl has until the fourth day.
On the third day, she is not allowed to eat rice in any form, but she
may partake of any other grain in the form of cakes. Her uncle&rsquo;s
wife, husband&rsquo;s sister, and other relations, give her presents
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>of cakes and bread. During the night, the
m&#257;ttu, or cloth-changing ceremony, takes place. First of all, the
washerman comes along with the washerwoman, carrying two washed cloths.
In the front yard of the house a lamp with an odd number of wicks is
burning. In a bamboo basket are a small measure (edang&#257;li) of
paddy heaped up on a plantain leaf, a measure of rice on another leaf,
two separate quarter measures thereof, a piece of turmeric, a little
straw, a piece of coir (cocoanut fibre), and a cocoanut. As soon as he
enters, the washerman, using the straw and coir skilfully, makes a
bundle of the contents of the basket, and places it near the lamp,
which is standing on a wooden stool. A cocoanut is cut in half, and
placed, half on each side, by the stool. Thereon is set a flat
bell-metal dish, containing a little rice and seven rolls of betel
leaves and areca nuts. The washerwoman, having received the m&#257;ttu
from the woman, places it on his head and proceeds to sing a song, at
the conclusion of which he says solemnly three times &ldquo;Let me
place the m&#257;ttu.&rdquo; He then places the cloths on the bundle,
which is on the stool. The girl&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s wife, and four
other women, have by this time emerged from the middle room of the
house, carrying a lighted lamp, a plate with a measure of rice, and a
kindi as before. The uncle&rsquo;s wife, having covered her breast with
a silk cloth, and wearing all her ornaments, leads the other four women
as they walk thrice round the m&#257;ttu. She then places a fanam (or a
four-anna piece) on the m&#257;ttu, lifts the stool, bundle and all,
with one hand on the m&#257;ttu and the other below the stool, and
leads the procession of the women, with the lamp and other articles, to
the room where the girl has been sleeping. She deposits her burden near
the spot where the girl has laid her head. A general feast <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>then
takes place, and the washerman appropriates the fanam, and the paddy
and rice spread in the yard. So ends the third day of these strange
observances. On the fourth day, the girl bathes in a neighbouring pool,
with some ceremonial. Before she leaves the house, the washerman fixes
in the ground a branch of a certain tree, to the top and bottom of
which he ties the two ends of a long line of thin coir rope or yarn.
This is supposed to represent the bow of K&#257;ma, the Indian Cupid.
He erects a miniature temple-like structure of young cocoanut leaves,
with the stems of young plantains near it, by the side of the pool.
Close to it, he places a burning lamp, and a small quantity of rice and
paddy, each on a separate plantain leaf. Near them he sets a cocoanut,
which has been blackened with charcoal, on some rice spread on a
plantain leaf, a cocoanut reddened with turmeric and chunam on raw
rice, and another on a leaf, containing fried paddy.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1717src" href="#xd21e1717" name="xd21e1717src">22</a> He
further deposits a few plantains, and two other cocoanuts. Before the
girl leaves the house, clad in one of the cloths brought on the
previous night, she is well rubbed all over with oil, and the four or
six women<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1720src" href="#xd21e1720" name=
"xd21e1720src">23</a> who accompany her are similarly treated. Leading
the way, they are followed by a number of women to the pool, where the
girl and her companions bathe. After the bath, they stand by the side
of the pool, facing east and holding lighted cotton-wicks in their
hands, and go round the miniature temple three times, throwing the
wicks into it. The washerman again breaks out into song, accompanying
himself by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>striking a bell-metal plate with a stick. When he
has finished, and gone through a little more business on his own
account, the girl&rsquo;s husband or brother (if she is unmarried)
appears on the scene. He holds aloft the coir string, under the lower
end of which a cocoanut has been placed on the ground. The girl passes
three times forwards and backwards without touching it. Two cotton
wicks, lighted at both ends, are laid on the cocoanut, and the girl
should cut the wicks and the cocoanut through, completely severing
them, with one blow of a strong knife or chopper. If she is successful,
the omen is considered good. The girl, with her party, then bathes a
second time. As she comes out of the water, she kicks out backwards
like a mule, and sends the stem with the single cocoanut attached
flying into the water with her right foot. The second m&#257;ttu cloth
is then brought, and she is clad in it. Then she is full dressed and
ornamented and led back to the house with a silk canopy over her head.
She is taken to the middle room, and cakes and rice are given to her to
eat. A feast is then held. The girl has so far been purified as regards
most affairs of life, but she cannot touch any cooking-vessel until she
has undergone yet another ceremony. This takes place on the seventh or
ninth day after the first appearance of the menses. Every day until
then the girl is rubbed with gingelly oil and turmeric. Three ordinary
earthenware cooking-pots are piled, one above the other, in the
kitchen. The uppermost pot contains cooked rice, the middle one rice
boiled with jaggery, and the lowest curry. The pots must be new, and
are marked with perpendicular daubs of chunam. Seated on a low wooden
stool to the west of the pots, the girl, facing the east, touches each
pot with a knife. When the first of all these menstruation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>ceremonies has taken place at the house of the
girl&rsquo;s husband, her mother brings some cakes on this last day. If
it has been performed at her father&rsquo;s house, her husband&rsquo;s
sister should bring the cakes. They are distributed among all present,
and a small meal is partaken of. All the expenses of the first, and
seventh or ninth day ceremonies, are borne by the people of the house,
who may be those of the family of the girl&rsquo;s father or husband.
The expenses of the ceremonial of the fourth day are defrayed by the
girl&rsquo;s husband if they have been performed at her father&rsquo;s
house, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>
<p>The young wife has an easy time of it until the fifth month of her
pregnancy, when she must again submit to becoming the subject for
ceremonial. Then takes place the Belikala, for the purpose of appeasing
some of the many malignant spirits, who are unceasing in their attempts
to destroy infants in the womb. This consists for the most part of
offerings, which are repeated in the seventh month. They are performed
by members of the Mann&#257;n (washerman) and P&#257;nan (exorcists and
devil-dancers) castes. At the commencement thereof, there is a feast. A
structure, in shape something like a Muhammadan taboot,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1732src" href="#xd21e1732" name=
"xd21e1732src">24</a> about five feet in height, is erected in the
front yard of the house. It is made of stems of young plantain trees,
and festooned with leaves of young cocoanut palms. The floor of the
little edifice, and the ground outside it to the west, are strewn with
charcoal made from paddy husk, on which are made magic squares of white
rice flour, intermingled with red, green, and yellow, each colour being
compounded with specified substances. The squares are not always the
same, but are prepared for each occasion, so as to suit <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>the
particular spirit which is to be invoked and appeased. The pregnant
woman, with six female companions, leaves the middle room of the house,
carrying the usual lamp and other articles, and they walk seven times
round the edifice. Before completing the last round, each throws into
it a burning wick. They then stand to the west of it, facing east, and
sit down. The Mann&#257;ns invoke the spirit in song, accompanied by
the clang of metal plates beaten with sticks. Drums must not be used.
The music and weird devil-dancing go on more or less all night, and by
morning some of the most nervous of the women, overcome by the spirit,
go into fits. The fees for the devil-dancing are paid by the pregnant
woman&rsquo;s father. Last of all, a live cock is held against the
forehead of the woman, mantrams (magical formul&aelig;) are repeated,
and rice is thrown over her head. If she should have a fit, the head of
the cock is cut off, and the blood offered to the demon spirit. If,
however, she does not suffer from undue excitement, the cock is simply
removed alive. She is left in peace for the next two months, when she
goes to her father&rsquo;s house, at which there is more devil-dancing
at another Belikala ceremony. The fees are paid by the woman&rsquo;s
husband. They vary from five to thirty-two rupees, according to the
cost of the edifice which is erected, and the quality of the dancing.
The invocation of some of the devils requires specially trained dancers
who must be paid high fees. On the morning following the dance, the
tamarind juice drinking ceremony takes place at the house of the
woman&rsquo;s father. The fees in connection with this are debited to
the husband. Taking advantage of an auspicious moment, the husband and
two companions bathe in the early morning, and make a neat toilette,
the husband wearing a necklace. They then go to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>nearest
tamarind, and pluck three small leafy twigs, which they bring to the
house. The husband&rsquo;s sister pounds the leaves in a mortar in a
little shed or pandal in the front yard. The juice is then strained
through a new double cloth eight cubits in length by the
husband&rsquo;s sisters. If he has no sisters, this should be done by
his and his wife&rsquo;s mothers. Rice conjee is then prepared with
water, in which the tamarind juice has been mixed. The husband, and his
two companions, sit under the pandal, where the usual lamp and other
articles have been placed, with the wife behind him. Her brother then
feeds him thrice with the conjee from a small gold spoon. The
husband&rsquo;s sister feeds the wife in like manner. One of the three
twigs is planted by the husband in the front yard, and his wife waters
it every day until the child is born. In the ninth month, the
husband&rsquo;s sister presents his wife with a couple of pounds of
cummin seed and jaggery. The woman who brings this little gift should
be given some cakes and sweetmeats. During pregnancy, a woman always
wears an amulet concealed within a cylindrical tube on her neck, to
protect her against malignant spirits.</p>
<p>The young wife&rsquo;s child is born at her father&rsquo;s house,
where she is under the care of her mother. When the child is born, the
brother of the newly made mother goes out into the yard, and strikes
the ground three times with the stem of a dry cocoanut palm leaf. If
the child is a boy, he emits a long drawn out ku-u-u-u in high falsetto
as he does so. It is then the duty of the brother and the midwife to go
and inform the father of the event. The midwife receives from him her
fee, and a present of a cloth, and other presents from his sisters. If
the child is a boy, the brother receives a cloth, and, if a girl, a
cloth and a bell-metal plate. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href=
"#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>The event of the birth of a child carries with it, as in the case of
death, pollution to every one in the house. This is partially removed
by ceremonies on the third day, and wholly by further ceremonies on the
ninth or eleventh day, whichever happens to be the more
auspicious&mdash;a Tuesday for example. Any one coming to the house
before the first ceremonies have taken place must bathe and wash his or
her cloth to remove the pollution. Any one visiting the house after the
first, but before the second ceremony, need not bathe, but cannot eat
any food in the house. The men of the household can get no rice at home
until after the second ceremony has been performed, and they are
consequently compelled to board elsewhere for the time being. A
washerwoman carries out the purification rites, assisted by a barber
woman. First of all, the floors of all the rooms are smeared with
cow-dung. All clothes in use are given to the washerwoman. The women
rub their bodies all over with oil, and the washerwoman brings
m&#257;ttu for them. The barber woman sprinkles a mixture of
cow&rsquo;s milk and karuka grass leaves over the women, who then go to
a pool and bathe. When the milk is about to be sprinkled, the usual
lamp, rice on a metal plate, and kindi of water are produced. The
barber woman takes the rice and one fanam, and receives also some
cocoanut and gingelly (<i lang="la-x-bio">Sesamum</i>) oil. Much the
same things are given to the washerwoman. The second ceremony is just
like the first, but, even after its completion, the women of the house
cannot touch any cooking-vessels until after the fifteenth day. The
ceremony of touching the cooking pots, as at the time of the first
menstrual period, is then performed. These three purificatory
ceremonies must be performed after every birth. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the twenty-seventh or fortieth day after the birth of a child,
the mother and the infant are taken back to the husband&rsquo;s house,
and cow&rsquo;s milk is for the first time given to the child. This
event, which has all the solemnity of a regular function, takes place
in the middle room, where the lamp, mat and other articles have been
arranged. The child&rsquo;s paternal grandfather, father&rsquo;s elder
brother, or other senior man administers the milk, which has been
boiled. A gold bracelet is dipped in it, and the drops of milk are made
to fall into the child&rsquo;s mouth. As this is being done, the
celebrant whispers in the child&rsquo;s right ear the name which will
be formally given to it in the sixth month. The eldest son is always
named after the paternal grandfather, and the second after the father.
In like manner, the eldest girl is named after its own mother.
Relations and friends take this opportunity to make presents of
bracelets and other articles to the infant. A feast is then held. After
the ceremony is over, the parents of the child&rsquo;s mother have to
send about half a bag of rice flour mixed with jaggery to her
husband&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>For the first six months of its life, a child&rsquo;s food consists
of nature&rsquo;s fount and cow&rsquo;s milk. It is then, before the
sixth month is over, given boiled rice for the first time. The ceremony
takes place either in the middle room of its father&rsquo;s house, or
at a temple. The child&rsquo;s grandfather, or the eldest male member
of the family, sits on a mat, and takes the child in his lap. With a
gold ring he applies honey three times to its mouth, and then gives it
a little rice three times. Female relations who are present follow his
example, giving the child first honey, and then rice. Several women,
with the lighted lamp and other articles, carry the child into the
yard, to show it the sky. They go round a cocoanut tree, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>stand before the front door, facing west. An elder
among the women of the house stands at the front door, calls out the
name of the child three times, and asks it to come inside. The
relations give little presents of ornaments, and there is a feast.</p>
<p>It will be observed that even a child&rsquo;s life is not entirely
free from ceremonial. When it has grown up, it undergoes more of it,
and, when it has lived its course on earth, is the subject of still
more ceremonial long after it is dead. All these affairs involve some
expenditure, but the one which literally runs away with money is
marriage. The others are not extravagances, nor are they as costly as
might be implied from the continual feasting of a large number of
people. We must not think of these feasts as of a banquet at the
Carlton, but as simple affairs, at which simple people are content with
simple though pleasing fare.</p>
<p>When a child is provided by nature with teeth, it is the subject of
a little ceremony, during which it is expected to disclose its natural
propensities. The usual mat and other articles are arranged, and there
are in addition a large flat bell-metal plate containing a rice cake, a
knife, a palmyra leaf grantham (book), a cocoanut, and a gold ornament.
The child is let loose, and allowed to pick out anything from the
plate. If it takes the cake, it will be greedy; if the knife, brave; if
the book, learned; if the cocoanut, a landlord; and, if the gold
ornament, rich.</p>
<p>A child&rsquo;s head is shaved in the third or fifth year. The
barber, who performs the operation, is allowed to take away the rice
which, with the lamp, is at hand. He also receives a fanam and a new
cloth. The people of the child&rsquo;s mother bring rice cakes.</p>
<p>The last day of the Dasara festival in the fifth year of a
child&rsquo;s life is that on which instruction in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>alphabet
begins. A teacher, who has been selected with care, or a lucky person
holds the child&rsquo;s right hand, and makes it trace the fifty-one
letters of the Malay&#257;lam alphabet on raw rice spread on a plate.
The fore-finger, which is the one used in offering water to the souls
of the dead and in other parts of the death ceremonies, must not be
used for tracing the letters, but is placed above the middle finger,
merely to steady it. For the same reason, a doctor, when making up a
pill, will not use the fore-finger. When, later on, the child goes to
the village school, the fifty-one letters are written one by one on its
tongue with a gold style, if one is available. As each letter is
formed, the child has to repeat the sound of it.</p>
<p>The lobes of both a child&rsquo;s ears are bored with a golden pin
or a thorn. The helix of the ear is not bored for the purpose of
inserting ornaments in it, but is sometimes bored as a remedy for
disease, <i>e.g.</i>, hernia. Everywhere else in Southern India, it is
common for people of almost every class to have the helix of the left
ear bored.</p>
<p>The t&#257;li-tying ceremony must be performed before a girl attains
puberty. The Tiyan t&#257;li is usually of gold, and worth about
half-a-crown. It is not the one which is worn in every day life, but
the one which is used in the ceremony about to be described. Throughout
Southern India, the t&#257;li is the ordinary symbol of marriage among
Hindus, and it is even worn by Syrian Christians. In Malabar, and the
Native States of Cochin and Travancore, it is a symbol of marriage,
with which a girl is ceremoniously adorned, as a rule before she is
affianced. The ceremony occupies three days, on the last of which the
t&#257;li is tied. On the first day, a shed or pandal is erected in the
front yard. Within it a similar structure is prepared with the leaves
of an areca <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>palm, which has been cut down at an auspicious
moment, and with the formal sanction of the Tand&#257;n of the tara.
This inner pandal is tastefully decorated with pictures and flowers. It
is important to note that this little pandal must not be begun until
the first day of the ceremony. On this day, the carpenter of the tara
brings a low wooden seat, rather long and narrow, made from the pala
tree (<i lang="la-x-bio">Alstonia scholaris</i>), which must be cut at
an auspicious moment, for which he receives one fanam. This seat is
called mana.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1777src" href="#xd21e1777"
name="xd21e1777src">25</a> A grass mat is spread in the middle room of
the house, with a white cloth over it, on which the mana is placed. A
lamp, vessel of water, and the usual paraphernalia are arranged on the
ground to the south close by. When these preliminaries have been
completed, the girl is brought by the uncle&rsquo;s wife to the pandal,
and seated on a stool. In front of her, a lamp, and other things which
are a feature in all ceremonials, and a measure of paddy are placed on
the ground, a gold fanam is put on her head, and over it gingelly oil
is poured. As the coin falls from the forehead, it is caught in a cup.
It is important which side falls uppermost. The girl is then taken to a
pool for bathing, and returns to the pandal. She is conducted to the
middle room of the house in procession, with a silk canopy over her
head and women carrying lamps, etc. She is confined in this room, which
is decorated in the manner described when speaking of the menstruation
ceremony, until the third day. She sleeps on a mat, surrounded by a
little ridge of rice and paddy, cocoanut and areca palm flowers, and
near her head is a copper pot marked with vertical daubs of white. The
blacksmith of the tara brings a little stick, called charathkot, with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>an iron blade at one end, which is supposed to
represent an arrow of K&#257;ma. This the girl keeps constantly at her
side, and carries in her hand when compelled by nature to leave the
room. While confined in the room, she is not allowed to eat fish,
flesh, or salt, or see any animals, especially a cat, dog, or crow. On
the third day, the t&#257;li is prepared on the spot by the village
goldsmith. The girl&rsquo;s uncle gives him the gold, which he melts,
and works at in the pandal at an auspicious moment. The paddy and rice,
which, with the lamp and vessel of water, have been in evidence during
the operations, are given to the goldsmith, with a fanam for his
labour. A weaver brings two new cloths, of a particular kind called
mantra-kodi, for which the girl&rsquo;s uncle pays. One is worn by the
girl, and the mana is covered with the other. The girl is taken to
bathe, and, after the bath, is richly dressed and ornamented, and
brought in procession, with a canopy over her head, to the house, where
she is conducted to the inner room. The mana is then placed, with the
cloth near it, on a grass mat in the inner pandal. The uncle&rsquo;s
wife sits on the mat, and the uncle lifts the girl, carries her three
times round the pandal, and deposits her in his wife&rsquo;s lap. The
astrologer, who is present, indicates the moment when the t&#257;li
should be tied. The girl&rsquo;s father gives him a fanam, and receives
from him a little rice, called muhurtham (auspicious time). When the
psychological moment has arrived he sprinkles the rice on the
girl&rsquo;s head, saying &ldquo;It is time.&rdquo; The t&#257;li is
then tied round the girl&rsquo;s neck by the uncle&rsquo;s wife. At the
upper end of the t&#257;li is a ring, through which the thread passes.
The thread which is used for the purpose is drawn from the cloth with
which the mana has been covered. [It is odd that there are some
families of N&#257;yars, who are not allowed to use a t&#257;li with a
ring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>to receive the string, and are therefore obliged
to make a hole in the t&#257;li itself.] As soon as the t&#257;li has
been tied on the girl&rsquo;s neck, a number of boys burst into song,
praising Ganapathi (the elephant god), and descriptive of the marriage
of King Nala and Damayanti, or of Sri Krishna and Rukmani. Every one
joins in, and the song ends with shouts and hurrahs. A mock feeding
ceremony is then carried out. Three plantain leaves are spread in front
of the girl in the pandal, and rice, plantains, and pappadams are
spread thereon. The uncle&rsquo;s wife offers some of each to the girl
three times, but does not allow her to touch it with her lips. The girl
is then taken to a temple, to invoke the God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>The description which has just been given is that of the ceremony
which is performed, if the girl has not been affianced. If a husband
has been arranged for her, it is he who ties the t&#257;li, and his
sister takes the place of the uncle&rsquo;s wife. Otherwise the
ceremony is the same, with this difference, however, that, when the
husband ties the t&#257;li, there can be no divorce, and the girl
cannot remarry in the event of his death.</p>
<p>In North, as in South Malabar, the t&#257;li-tying ceremony is
always performed before puberty, and occupies four days. This is the
orthodox procedure. The girl wears a cloth provided by the <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1788" title="Source: washer woman">washerwoman</span>.
She is taken from the middle room of the house to the yard, and there
seated on a plank of pala wood. Placed in front of her are a small
measure of rice and paddy, a washed white cloth, and a small bell-metal
vessel (kindi) on a bell-metal plate. The barber pours cocoanut water
on her head, on which a silver and copper coin have been placed. One of
her relations then pours water from a vessel containing some raw rice
over her head, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>using two halves of a cocoanut as a spout. The
girl is then taken back to the middle room, where she remains for three
days. There is a feast in the evening. On the fourth day, a pandal is
erected in the front yard, and decorated. The girl is taken to bathe at
a neighbouring pool, preceded by women carrying a lamp, a kindi of
water, and other things which have been already described. During her
absence, the barber performs p&#363;ja to Ganapathi in the pandal.
After bathing, she cuts a cocoanut in half, and returns in procession,
with a silk canopy over her head, amid music and singing, and enters
the middle room of the house. The barber woman ties a gold ornament
(netti pattam) on her forehead, which she marks with sandal paste, and
blackens her eyes with eye-salve. The uncle&rsquo;s wife, preceded by
women bearing a lamp and other articles, carries the mana, covered with
cloth, from the middle room to the pandal. She walks three times round
the pandal, and places the mana on a grass mat, over which has been
spread some paddy and some rice where the girl will put her foot. The
women who have carried the lamp, etc., return to the room, and escort
the girl to the pandal. She walks thrice round it, and takes her seat
on the mana. The barber hands her a little rice, which she throws on
the lighted lamp, and articles which have been used in the p&#363;ja to
Ganapathi, and on the post supporting the south-west corner of the
pandal. This post should be of pala wood, or have a twig of that tree
tied to it. More rice is handed to the girl, and she throws it to the
cardinal points of the compass, to the earth, and to the sky. A small
earthen pot containing rice, a cocoanut, betel, and areca nuts, is
placed near the girl. Into this a variety of articles, each tied up
separately in a piece of plantain leaf, are placed. These consist of a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>gold coin, a silver coin, salt, rice, paddy,
turmeric, charcoal, and pieces of an old cadjan leaf from the thatch of
the house. The mouth of the pot is then covered over with a plantain
leaf tied with string. The girl sprinkles rice three times over the
pot, makes a hole in the leaf, and picks out one of the articles, which
is examined as an augur of her destiny. Betel leaves and areca nuts are
then passed twice round her head, and thrown away. She next twists off
a cocoanut from a bunch hanging at a corner of the pandal. Then follows
the presentation of cloths called mantra-kodi. These must be new, and
of a particular kind. Each of her relations throws one of these cloths
over the girl&rsquo;s head. Half of them (perhaps ten or twelve) go to
the barber, who, at this point, pours cocoanut water from the leaf of a
banyan tree on her head, on which a silver and copper coin have been
placed. The astrologer is then asked whether it is time to tie the
t&#257;li, and replies three times in the affirmative. The barber woman
hands the t&#257;li strung on a thread to the girl&rsquo;s
uncle&rsquo;s wife, who ties it round the girl&rsquo;s neck. The barber
woman then pours water on the girl&rsquo;s hands. Three times the water
is flung upwards, and then to the east, west, south, and north. A
cotton wick, steeped in oil, is then twisted round a piece of bamboo,
and stuck on a young cocoanut. The girl is asked if she sees the sun,
looks at the lighted wick, and says that she does. She is then taken to
a cocoanut tree, preceded by the lamp, etc. She walks three times round
the tree, and pours water over the root. The ceremony is now concluded,
and the girl is marched back to the middle room.</p>
<p>A variation of the t&#257;li-tying ceremony, as performed in
Chavakad on the coast between Calicut and Cochin, may be briefly
described, because it possesses some <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>interesting features. It
is always done by the intended husband, or some one representing him.
Seven days prior to the beginning of the ceremony, the carpenter of the
tara, with the permission of the Tand&#257;n (here called
Avak&#257;si), cuts down an areca palm, and fixes part of it as the
south-east post of the booth, at which the t&#257;li will be tied. On
the sixth day, the girl is formally installed in the middle room of the
house. The carpenter brings a mana of pala wood, the cost of which is
paid by the father, and does p&#363;ja to it. The bridegroom&rsquo;s
party arrive. A lamp is lighted in the booth, which is at this time
partly, but not entirely, made ready. Near the lamp are placed a
measure of paddy, half a measure (n&#257;zhi) of rice, a looking-glass,
a kindi of water, and a wooden cheppu (a rude vessel with a sliding
cover). The wives of the Tand&#257;n and uncle, together with some
other women, bring the girl, and seat her on the mana. The
uncle&rsquo;s wife parts her hair, and places a gold fanam on her
crown. The Tand&#257;n&rsquo;s wife then pours a little oil on it over
a leaf of the j&#257;k tree three times. The other women do the same.
The girl is then taken to a pool, and bathed. Before her return, the
mana should be placed ready for her in the middle room of the house. In
the evening there is a feast. On the day but one following, the
t&#257;li is tied. The last post of the booth is put up, and it is
completed and decorated on the t&#257;li-tying day. A lamp,
looking-glass, and other things are put in it. A grass mat is spread on
the floor, and a kambli (blanket) and a whitewashed cloth are placed
over it. On either side of it is placed a pillow. The bridegroom and
his party wait in an adjoining house, for they must not appear on the
scene until the psychological moment arrives. The Tand&#257;n of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s tara, with a few friends, comes first, and hands
over two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>cloths and ten rupees eight annas to the
bride&rsquo;s Tand&#257;n. The girl is dressed in one of these cloths,
and led to the booth, the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister holding her by the
hand. She sits on the mana, which has been brought, and placed on the
cloth, by her uncle. The bridegroom comes in procession, carried on his
uncle&rsquo;s shoulders. The girl is still a child, and he is only a
few years her senior. His uncle puts him down on the right side of the
girl, after walking thrice round the booth. The girl&rsquo;s
uncle&rsquo;s wife sits close to her, on the other side, on the mana.
Her father asks the astrologer three times if it is the proper time to
tie the t&#257;li, and is answered thrice in the affirmative. Then the
boy bridegroom ties the t&#257;li on the girl&rsquo;s neck. The boy and
girl sing out a chorus in praise of Ganapathi, and end up with three
loud shouts and hurrahs. Then the boy seats himself on the ground,
outside the pillow. The girl is taken inside the house, and, after a
general feast, is brought back, and seated on the mana, and rice and
flowers are sprinkled. No money is paid to the uncle&rsquo;s son, as at
Calicut. The boy bridegroom pays eight annas to his sister for leading
the bride by the hand. When the marriage has been done by proxy, the
boy bridegroom is selected from a tarwad into which the girl might
marry. He stays at the girl&rsquo;s house for three days, and, on the
fourth day, the boy and girl are taken to a temple. A formal divorce is
effected, and the boy is taken away.</p>

</div>
<p>It will not be worth while to attempt a description of the marriage
ceremony of the Tiyans of North Malabar, because there is none, or next
to none. There the Tiyans and all classes, including even the
Muhammadan M&#257;ppillas, follow the rule of marumakkat&#257;yam, or
inheritance through females from uncle to nephew. The children have no
right to their father&rsquo;s property. Either <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>party
may annul the marital union at will, without awarding any compensation;
and, as its infraction is easy and simple, so is its institution. Nor
is there any rigid inquiry as to the antecedents of either party. It is
an affair of mutual arrangement, attended with little formality.
Proceeding to the girl&rsquo;s house, accompanied by a few friends, the
intending husband takes with him a couple of cloths, one for the girl,
and the other for her mother. In parts of North Malabar, the Tiyan
women wear an ornament called chittu (ring) in a hole bored in the top
of the helix of each ear. The holes are bored in childhood, but the
chittu is not worn until the girl forms a marital union with a man. The
chittus are made on the spot at the time, in the marriage pandal
erected for the occasion, the girl&rsquo;s uncle providing the gold.
They are never removed during life, except in cases of dire distress.
&ldquo;To sell chittu&rdquo; is equivalent to having become a pauper.
It is supposed that, in olden days, the marriage ceremonies lasted over
seven days, and were subsequently reduced to seven meals, or three and
a half days, and then to one day. Now the bridegroom remains the first
night at the bride&rsquo;s house, and then takes her to his home.
Before they leave, a cocoanut, the outer husk of which has been
removed, is placed on a stool of pala wood, and one of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party must smash it with his fist. Some of the more
orthodox in North Malabar observe the formality of examining
horoscopes, and a ceremony equivalent to the conjee-drinking ceremony
which has been described, called ach&#257;ra kali&#257;na, and the
payment of kanam in the shape of forty-one fanams, instead of forty-two
as in South Malabar. In connection with fanams it may be noted that the
old gold fanam is reckoned as worth four annas, whereas five silver or
velli fanams make a rupee. Everywhere <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>in rural Malabar,
calculations are made in terms of velli fanams thus:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>10 pice (1/12 of an anna) = 1 velli.</li>
<li>5 vellis = 1 rupee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bazaar men, and those who sell their small stock at the weekly
markets all about the country, arrange their prices in vellis.</p>
<p>When the death of a Tiyan is expected, all the relations draw near,
and await the fateful moment. The person who is about to die is laid on
the floor of the middle room, for it is inauspicious to die on a cot.
We will suppose that the dying man is a parent and a landlord. Each of
the sons and daughters gives him a little conjee water, just before he
passes away. At the moment of death, all the women bawl out in
lamentations, giving the alarm of death. The Cheruman serfs in the
fields join in the chorus, and yell out an unintelligible formula of
their own. Absent relations are all formally invited. From the houses
of the son&rsquo;s wife and daughter&rsquo;s husband are sent
quantities of j&#257;k fruits, unripe plantains, and cocoanuts, as
death gifts. One half of the husks of the cocoanuts is removed, and the
other half left on the shell. After the cremation or burial, these
articles are distributed among those present by the Tand&#257;n, who
receives an extra share for his trouble. When life is extinct, the body
is placed with the head to the south, and the thumbs and big toes are
tied together. It is then taken out into the yard, washed, bathed in
oil, dressed in a new cloth, and brought back to the middle room. A
cocoanut is cut in two, and the two halves, with a lighted wick on
each, are placed at the head and foot. The house-owner spreads a cotton
cloth over the corpse, and all the relations, and friends, do the same.
Any one who wishes to place a silk cloth on the corpse may <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>do so,
but he must cover it with a cotton cloth. The body is then removed for
burial or cremation, and placed near the grave or funeral pyre. It is
the rural rule that elderly persons and karnavans of tarwads are
cremated, and others buried. The barber, whose function it is to
perform the purificatory rites, now removes, and retains as his
perquisite, all the cloths, except the last three covering the corpse.
As it is being borne away to the place of burial or cremation, water
mixed with cow-dung is sprinkled behind it in the yard. The eldest son,
who succeeds to the property and is responsible for the funeral
ceremonies, then tears crosswise a piece of the cloth which has been
placed over the corpse by the people of the house, and ties it round
his forehead. He holds one end of the cloth while the barber holds the
other, and tears off the piece. The barber then cuts three holes in the
remainder of this cloth covering the body, over the mouth, navel, and
pubes. A little water and rice are poured over a gold fanam through the
slit over the mouth. All who observe the death pollution, <i>i.e.</i>,
sons, grandsons, nephews, younger brothers and cousins, offer water and
rice in the same manner, and walk three times round the grave or pyre.
The barber then breaks a pot of water over the grave. No other
ceremonial is observed on this day, on which, and during the night,
rice must not be eaten. If the body has been cremated, a watch is kept
at the burning ground for five days by P&#257;nans, who beat drums all
night to scare away the evil spirits which haunt such spots. Early on
the second day, all who are under pollution are shaved. The operation
is attended with some ceremonial, and, before it is commenced, a
lighted lamp, a measure of rice and paddy on a plantain leaf must be at
hand. The paddy and rice are a perquisite of the barber. Those who have
been shaved <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>bathe, and then follows the crow-feeding ceremony.
Rice is boiled in a bell-metal vessel over a hearth prepared with three
young cocoanuts. The eldest son, who tore the cloth of succession from
the corpse, makes the rice into two little balls, places them on a
plantain leaf, and offers them to the spirit of the departed by pouring
libations of water on them over a blade of karuka grass. Men and women
who are under pollution then do the same. The rice balls are eaten by
crows. This little ceremony is performed daily until the eleventh or
thirteenth day, when the period of death pollution comes to an end. If
the eleventh day happens to fall on a Tuesday or Friday, or on any
inauspicious day, the period is extended to the thirteenth day. When
the period of death pollution is partly in one month, and partly in
another, another death in the house within the year is expected.
Preceding the sanchayanam, which occupies the fifth day, there is the
lamp-watching on the previous night. In the south-east corner of the
middle room, a little paddy is heaped up, and on it is placed a
bell-metal plate with an iron lamp having five or seven lighted wicks
on it. Under the lamp is a little cow-dung, and close to it is a bunch
of cocoanut flowers. The lamp must be kept burning until it is
extinguished on the following day. In the case of the death of a male,
his niece watches the lamp, and in that of a female her daughter, lying
near it on a grass mat. The sanchayanam is the first stage in the
removal of death pollution, and, until it is over, all who come to the
house suffer from pollution, and cannot enter their own house or
partake of any food without bathing previously. When the body has been
cremated, the fragments of calcined bones are collected from the ashes,
and carried in procession to the sea, or, if this is far away, into a
river. The members of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86"
name="pb86">86</a>]</span>the family under pollution then rub their
bodies all over with oil, and the barber sprinkles a mixture of
cow&rsquo;s milk over their heads, using a blade of karuka grass as a
spout. They then bathe, and the eldest son alone observe m&#257;ttu.
The crow-feeding ceremony follows, and, when this is over, the three
cocoanuts which were used as a hearth are thrown away. A large
bell-metal vessel filled with water is now placed in the front yard
before the door of the house. The barber carries the still burning lamp
from the middle room, and sets it on the ground near the pot of water.
The women who are under pollution come from the middle room, each
carrying a lighted wick, walk thrice round the pot, and throw the wicks
into the water. The woman who has watched the lamp puts four annas into
the pot, and the others deposit a few pies therein. The eldest son now
lights a wick from the iron lamp which is about to be extinguished, and
with it lights a lamp in the middle room. The barber then dips the iron
lamp in the water, and picks out the money as his perquisite. The water
is poured on the roots of a cocoanut tree. The bell-metal vessel
becomes the property of the woman who watched the lamp, but she cannot
take it away until she leaves the house after the pula-kuli ceremony.
When the lamp has been extinguished, a woman, hired for the occasion,
is seated on a cocoanut leaf in the front yard. The Tand&#257;n pours
oil on her head three times, and she receives a little betel and two
annas. She rises, and leaves the place without turning back, taking the
pollution with her. Betel is then distributed. Those who provided the
death gifts on the day of the death must on this day bring with them a
bag of rice, and about four rupees in money. They have also to give
eight annas to the barber. A folded handkerchief is first <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>presented to the barber, who formally returns it,
and receives instead of it the eight annas. Before the people disperse,
the day of the pula-kuli is settled. Pula-kuli, or washing away the
pollution, is the final ceremony for putting off the unpleasant
consequences of a death in a family. First of all, the members thereof
rub themselves all over with oil, and are sprinkled by the barber with
cow&rsquo;s milk and gingelly oil. They then bathe. The barber outlines
the figure of a man or woman, according to the sex of the deceased,
with rice flour and turmeric powder, the head to the south, in the
middle room of the house. The figure is covered with two plantain
leaves, on each of which a little rice and paddy are heaped. Over all
is spread a new cloth, with a basket containing three measures of paddy
upon it. The eldest son (the heir) sits facing the south, and with a
n&#257;zhi measures out the paddy, which he casts to the south, east,
and west&mdash;not the north. He repeats the performance, using the
fingers of the left hand closed so as to form a cup as a measure. Then,
closing the first and fourth fingers firmly with the thumb, using the
left hand, he measures some paddy in the same manner with the two
extended fingers. Rice is treated in the same way. A n&#257;zhi of
paddy, with a lighted wick over it, is then placed in a basket. The
eldest son takes the n&#257;zhi in his left hand, passes it behind his
body, and, receiving it with his right hand, replaces it in the basket.
The wick is extinguished by sprinkling it with water three times. At
the head of the figure on the floor is placed a clean cloth&mdash;the
washerman&rsquo;s m&#257;ttu. It is folded, and within the folds are
three n&#257;zhis of rice. On the top of it a cocoanut is placed. In
the four corners a piece of charcoal, a little salt, a few chillies,
and a gold fanam are tied. The eldest son, who is always the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>protagonist in all the ceremonies after death,
lifts the cloth with all its contents, places it on his head, and
touches with it his forehead, ears, each side and loins, knees and
toes. He does this three times. The plantain leaves are then removed
from the figure. A little turmeric powder is taken from the outline,
and rubbed on the forehead of the eldest son. He then bows thrice to
the figure, crossing his legs and arms so that the right hand holds the
left ear, and the left the right ear, and touches the ground with the
elbow-joints. It is no joke to do this. All this time, the eldest son
wears round his forehead the strip torn from the cloth which covered
the corpse. There is nothing more to be done in the middle room for the
present, and the eldest son goes out into the yard, and cooks the rice
for the final feed to the crows. Three n&#257;zhis of this rice must be
pounded and prepared for cooking by the woman who watched the lamp on
the fourth night after death. Having cooked the rice, the eldest son
brings it into the middle room, and mixes it with some unrefined sugar,
plantains and pappadams, making two balls, one large and one small.
Each of these he places on a plantain leaf. Then some p&#363;ja is done
to them, and offerings of rice are made over a gold fanam. The balls
are given to the crows in the yard, or, in some cases, taken to the sea
or a river, and cast into the water. When this course is adopted,
various articles must be kept ready ere the return of the party. These
comprise a new pot containing water, a branch of areca blossoms, mango
leaves, a kindi containing a gold fanam or gold ring, a little salt and
rice, each tied up in a piece of cloth, and a few chillies. The mouth
of the pot is covered with a plantain leaf, and secured. There are also
two stools, made of pala and mango wood. The eldest son sits on one of
these, and places <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89"
name="pb89">89</a>]</span>his feet on the other, so that he does not
touch the ground. The water in the pot is sprinkled with mango leaves
by the barber to the north, south, east and west, and on the head of
the son. The remainder of the water is then poured over his head. The
barber then sprinkles him with cocoanut water, this time using areca
blossoms, and makes him sip a little thereof. The barber makes a hole
in the plantain leaf, and picks out the contents. The eldest son
bathes, and after the bath there is a presentation of gifts. The
barber, sitting in the verandah beside the son, first gives to each
person under pollution a little salt and raw rice, which they eat. He
then gives them a little betel leaf and a small piece of areca nut, and
receives in return a quarter of an anna. The eldest son chews the betel
which he has received, and spits into a spittoon held by the barber,
whose property it becomes. Then to the barber, who has been presented
with a new mat to sit on and new cloth to wear before he seats himself
in the verandah, are given an ear-ring such as is worn by Tiyan women,
a silk cloth, a white cotton cloth, and a few annas. If the deceased
has been cremated he is given six fanams, and, if buried, five fanams
as the fee for his priestly offices. On an occasion of this kind,
several barbers, male and female, turn up in the hope of receiving
presents. All who help during the various stages of the ceremonial are
treated in much the same way, but the senior barber alone receives the
officiating fee. It is odd that the barbers of the four surrounding
villages are entitled to receive gifts of new cloths and money. Those
under death pollution are forbidden to eat fish or flesh, chew betel,
or partake of jaggery. The restriction is removed on the pula-kuli day.
The last act for their removal is as follows. The barber is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>required to eat some jaggery, and drink some
conjee. After this, the eldest son, the Tand&#257;n, and a neighbour,
sit on a mat spread in the middle of the house, and formally partake of
conjee and jaggery. The pula-kuli is then over.</p>
<p>It is a sacred duty to a deceased person who was one of importance,
for example the head of a family, to have a silver image of him made,
and arrange for it being deposited in some temple, where it will
receive its share of p&#363;ja (worship), and offerings of food and
water. The new-moon day of the months Karkitakam (July-August), Tulam
(October-November), and Kumbham (February-March) is generally selected
for doing this. The temples at Tirunelli in Wyn&#257;d and Tirunavayi,
which are among the oldest in Malabar, were generally the
resting-places of these images, but now some of the well-to-do deposit
them much further afield, even at Benares and R&#257;m&#275;svaram. A
silver image is presented to the local Siva temple, where, for a
consideration, p&#363;ja is done every new-moon day. On each of these
days, mantrams are supposed to be repeated a thousand times. When the
image has been the object of these mantrams sixteen thousand times, it
is supposed to have become eligible for final deposit in a temple. It
is this image which rests in the temple at Tirunavayi, or
elsewhere.</p>
<p>An annual sr&#257;dh ceremony is performed for the sake of the
spirit of the deceased, at which crows are fed in the manner already
described, and relations are fed. On the night of this day, some
sweetmeats or cakes, such as the deceased was fond of during life, are
offered to the spirit. A lamp is placed on a stool, and lighted in the
middle room of the house, with a kindi of water and a young cocoanut
near it. The cakes or sweetmeats <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91"
href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>are placed in front of the
stool. Children sprinkle rice over it, and the door is shut for a
quarter of an hour. The individual who feeds the crows should partake
of only one meal, without fish or flesh, on the previous day. Another
ceremony, which is necessary for the repose of the dead, is called
badha-velichatu-variethal, or bringing out the spirit. It cannot be
performed until at least a year after death, for during that period the
spirit is in a sort of purgatory. After that, it may be invoked, and it
will answer questions. The ceremony resembles the nelikala pregnancy
ceremony. The performers are P&#257;nans or washermen. Some little
girls are seated in front of a booth in the yard. The celebrant of the
rite sings, invoking the spirit of the deceased. Late at night, one of
the girls becomes possessed by the spirit, and, it is said, talks and
acts just like the deceased, calling the children, relations and
friends by name, talking of the past, and giving commands for the
future conduct of the living members of the family. After this, the
spirit is severed from earthly trammels, and attains heavenly
bliss.</p>
<p>The wood used for the purpose of cremation is that of a mango tree,
which must be cut down after the death. A little sandalwood and cuscus
(grass) roots are sometimes added to the pyre. In these days, when the
important and interesting features of ceremonial are fast disappearing,
it is not surprising that dried cakes of cow-dung are superseding the
mango wood.</p>
<p>Among other ceremonies, there is one called kutti p&#363;ja, which
is performed when a newly built house is taken charge of. Vastu Purusha
is the name of the supreme being which, lying on its back with its head
to the north-east and legs to the south-west, supports the earth. Or
rather the earth is but a small portion of this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>vast
body. Forests are its tiny hairs, oceans its blood-vessels, and the
wind its breath. In this body are fifty-three deities, who are liable
to disturbance when the surface of the earth is dug, when trees are
felled, foundations laid, and a house built. These angry beings must be
propitiated, or there will be untimely deaths, poverty, and sickness
among the inmates. The ceremony is performed in the following manner. A
square with fifty-three columns is made with rice flour in the middle
room of the house, and each column is filled with yellow, red, and
black powder. A plantain leaf is placed over it, and a few measures of
paddy are set on the top of the leaf. On this is placed another leaf,
with various kinds of grain, plantains, cocoanuts, and jaggery on it.
The carpenter, who is the architect and builder of the house, then
performs p&#363;ja with flowers, incense and lights, and the
troublesome imp-spirit Gulikan is propitiated with toddy and arrack,
and a fowl which is decapitated for him. Then all the
workmen&mdash;carpenters, masons, and coolies&mdash;walk thrice round
the house, breaking cocoanuts on the walls and doors, and howling in
order to drive away all evil spirits which may by chance be lurking
about the place. After this, they are all fed until they cry out
&ldquo;We are satisfied, and want no more.&rdquo; They are given cloths
and other presents, and the chief feature of the ceremony takes place.
This is the formal handing over of the house by the carpenter. He hands
it over to a third person, and never directly to the owner. It is not
always easy to find a third person who is willing to undertake the
responsibility, and who is at the same time suitable for the Gulikan
who is dispossessed of the house, and pursues him henceforth, following
him who first receives charge of the house. He should be a man who
brings luck, cheerful and contented, having a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>family,
and not labouring under any disorder or sickness of body. There is, or
was a few years ago, an old N&#257;yar living not far from Calicut, who
was much sought after to fulfil the functions of third person on these
occasions, and all the houses he received prospered. The third person
is generally a poor man, who is bribed with presents of cloths, money
and rice, to undertake the job. He wears one of the new cloths during
the ceremony. When the carpenter&rsquo;s ceremonies have been
completed, this man is taken to the middle room of the house, and made
to stand facing the door, with each foot on a plantain leaf. Pieces of
the thatch are tied to the four corners of his cloth. He shuts the
door, opens it, and shuts it again. The carpenter calls from without,
asking him whether he has taken charge of the house. He replies
evasively &ldquo;Have the carpenters and workmen received all their
wages? If they have, I take charge of the house.&rdquo; The carpenter
does not answer the question, for, if he did so, the mischief would be
transferred to him through the house-owner. So he says &ldquo;I did not
ask you about my wages. Have you taken charge of the house?&rdquo; The
man inside answers as before, adding &ldquo;otherwise not.&rdquo; The
carpenter again says &ldquo;I did not ask you about my wages. Answer me
straight. Have you, or have you not taken charge of the house?&rdquo;
The man inside replies &ldquo;I have taken charge of the house,&rdquo;
and opens the door. Taking in his hands the plantain leaves on which he
stood, he runs away as fast as he can without looking back. This he
must not do on any account. The people pelt him with plantains, and
hoot at him as he runs, and water mingled with cow-dung is sprinkled in
his path. After all this, cow&rsquo;s milk is boiled with a little rice
in the house, of which every one partakes, and the owner assumes charge
of his house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=

<p>In the pre-British days, a few of the well-to-do families of Tiyans
lived in houses of the kind called nalapura (four houses), having an
open quadrangle in the centre. But, for the most part, the
Tiyans&mdash;slaves of the N&#257;yars and Namb&#363;tiris&mdash;lived
in a one-roomed thatched hut. Nowadays, the kala pura usually consists
of two rooms, east and west.</p>
<p>Toddy-drawing, and every thing connected with the manufacture and
sale of arrack (country liquor) and unrefined sugar, form the orthodox
occupation of the Tiyan. But members of the community are to be found
in all classes of society, and in practically all professions and walks
of life. It is interesting to find that the head of a Tiyan family in
North Malabar bears the title Cherayi Panikar, conferred on the family
in the old days by a former Zamorin. A title of this kind was given
only to one specially proficient in arms. Even in those days there were
Tiyan physicians, bone-setters, astrologers, diviners, and
sorcerers.</p>
<p>It is easy to identify the toddy-tapper by the indurated skin of the
palms, fingers, inner side of the forearms, and the instep. The
business of toddy-tapping involves expert climbing, while carrying a
considerable paraphernalia, with no adventitious aid other than can be
got out of a soft grummet of coir to keep the feet near together, while
the hands, with the arms extended, grasp the palm tree. The profession
is rarely adopted before the age of eighteen, but I have seen a man who
said he began when he was twelve years old. It is very hard work. A
tapper can work about fifteen trees, each of which he has to climb
three times a day. In the northern districts of the Madras Presidency,
among the Telugu population, the toddy-drawers use a ladder about eight
or nine feet in length, which is placed against the tree, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>to avoid
climbing a third or a fourth of it. While in the act of climbing up or
down, they make use of a wide band, which is passed round the body at
the small of the back, and round the tree. This band is easily fastened
with a toggle and eye. The back is protected by a piece of thick soft
leather. It gives great assistance in climbing, which it makes easy.
All over the southernmost portion of the peninsula, among the
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns and Tiyans, the ladder and waist-band are unknown.
They climb up and down with their hands and arms, using only the
grummet on the feet. The Tiyan toddy-tapper&rsquo;s equipment consists
of a short-handled hatchet, about seven inches square, of thin iron,
sheathed in a wooden case, and fastened to a waist-belt composed of
several strings of coir yarn, to which is hung a small pot of gummy
substance obtained by bruising the leaves of the aichil plant. A vessel
holding a couple of gallons, made out of the spathe of the areca palm,
is used for bringing down the toddy. Tucked into the waist-belt is a
bone loaded with lead at either end, which is used for tapping the palm
to bring out the juice. A man once refused to sell at any price one of
these bones&mdash;the femur of a s&#257;mbar (<i lang="la-x-bio">Cervus
unicolor</i>), which had such virtue that, according to its owner, it
would fetch palm juice out of any tree. The garb of the tapper at work
consists of a short cloth round the loins, and (always during the
rains, and often at other times) a head-covering somewhat pointed in
shape, made of the leaves of the cocoanut palm placed together as in a
clinker-built boat, or of a rounded shape, made out of the spathe of
the areca palm. The toddy-tapper should go through the show of
reverence by touching the cocoanut tree with the right hand, and then
applying his hand to the forehead, every time he prepares to climb a
tree. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>In connection with toddy-drawing, the following note occurs in the
Gazetteer of Malabar. &ldquo;The tapper and the toddy shopkeeper are
generally partners, the former renting the trees, paying the tree-tax,
and selling the toddy at fixed prices to the latter. Sometimes the
shopkeeper pays both rent and tax, and the tapper is his servant paid
by the bottle. The trees are rented half yearly, and the rent varies
between Re. 1 and Re. 1&ndash;8&ndash;0 per tree. They are fit for
tapping as soon as they come into bearing, but four years later and in
the succeeding decade are most productive. They are seldom tapped for
more than six months in the year, and the process, though it shortens
the life of the tree, improves the yield of nuts in the rest of the
year. The tapper&rsquo;s outfit is neither costly nor elaborate. A
knife in a wooden case, a bone weighted with lead (the leg bone of a
sambhur for choice), a few pots, and two small rings of rope with which
to climb complete the tale. Operations begin when the spathe is still
enclosed by its sheath. Once a day the spathe is gently bruised on
either side with the bone, and on the third and following days a thin
slice is cut off the end twice a day. On the fifteenth day drawing
begins, and the bruising ceases. Sheath and spathe are swathed for the
greater part of their length in a thick covering of leaves or fibre;
the ends are still cut off twice or three times a day, but, after each
operation, are smeared with a paste made of leaves and water with the
object, it is said, of keeping the sap from oozing through the wound
and rotting the spathe. The leaves used for this purpose are those of
the &eacute;echal or vetti tree, which are said to be one and the same
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Aporosa Lindleyana</i>); but in British Cochin,
where the tree does not grow, backwater mud is utilised. Round the
space between the end of the sheath and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>thick
covering of leaves a single leaf is bound, and through this the sap
bleeds into a pot fastened below. The pot is emptied once a day in the
morning. The yield of sap varies with the quality of the tree and the
season of the year. In the hot months the trees give on an average
about a bottle a day, in the monsoon and succeeding months as much as
three bottles. In the gardens along the backwaters, south of
Ch&#275;ttuv&#257;yi, Messrs. Parry &amp; Co. consider that in a good
year they should get a daily average of three bottles or half a gallon
of toddy per tree. A bottle of toddy sells for three or four
pies.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">Tiya females at a coir factory.</p>
</div>
<p>In connection with the coir industry, it is noted, in the Gazetteer
of Malabar, that &ldquo;the husks of the cocoanuts are buried in pits
as near as possible to the waterline of rivers, backwaters and creeks,
and are left to soak for six months, a year, or even eighteen
months&mdash;the longer the better. The colour of the yarn, and thereby
the quality, depends very much on the water in which the husks are
steeped. It should be running water, and, if possible, fresh water. If
the water be salt, the yarn may at first be almost white, but in a damp
climate it soon becomes discoloured and blotchy. As soon as the husks
are taken out of the pits, the fibre is beaten out with short sticks by
Tiyattis (Tiyan females) and women of the V&#275;ttuvan caste. It is
dried in the sun for twelve hours, and is then ready for sale to native
merchants at Calicut and Cochin, who in their turn deal with the
European firms. The fibre is twisted into yarn by Tiyattis and other
women, and in that form the greater part of the coir made in Malabar is
exported from Cochin to all parts of the world, but chiefly to the
United Kingdom and Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been said that &ldquo;in North Malabar the preparation of
coir is a regular cottage industry of the most <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>typical
kind. Throughout the year, wherever one goes, one hears the noise of
the women hammering out the fibre, and sees them taking, in the
evening, that part of it which they have rolled into yarn to the
nearest little wayside shop, to be exchanged for salt, chillies, paddy,
etc. But, in the north of the district, nothing of the kind goes on,
and the coir is commonly used as fuel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been already stated that marumakkat&#257;yam, or inheritance
through nephews, is the invariable rule in North Malabar, being
followed even by the Muhammadan M&#257;ppillas. In South Malabar, where
the Tiyans do not observe marumakkat&#257;yam, the property devolves
through the sons. All sons share alike. Daughters have no share. The
practice of polyandry, which still exists in Malabar among the Tiyans
(and other classes), and which was probably once general, tends to
prevent dispersion of the family property. Although theoretically all
sons share the property of their father, it is the eldest son who
succeeds to possession and management of the tarwad property. The
others are entitled to maintenance only, so long as they remain in the
same tarwad house. It is the same among the Izhuvans.</p>
<p>Beef, as in the case of all Hindus, is forbidden as an article of
diet. The staple food is rice with fish curry. The common beverage is
conjee, but this is being supplanted by tea, coffee, lemonade, and
soda-water.</p>
<p>A loin-cloth, which should not reach to the knees, with a Madras
handkerchief on the shoulders, is the orthodox dress of the males, and
a double loin-cloth that of females. Women were not allowed to wear
anything above the waist, except when under death pollution. Any colour
might be worn, but white and blue are most common. A ring, composed of
hollow gold beads, called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href=
"#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>mani-kathila, is the proper ornament
for a Tiyan woman&rsquo;s ear. Twenty or thirty, with a pendant in the
middle, might be worn. Gold or silver bracelets could be worn. Hollow
silver bracelets were worn by girls until the birth of their first
child. But times have changed, and nowadays Tiyan women wear the
ornaments which, strictly speaking, appertain to N&#257;yar and
Br&#257;hman women. Their mode of tying the hair, and even their dress,
which is inclined to follow the fashion of the Christians, has changed.
In olden days, a Tiyan woman could wear an ornament appropriate for a
N&#257;yar on a special occasion, but only with the permission of the
N&#257;yar landlord, obtained through the Tand&#257;n, on payment of a
fee.</p>
<p>In North Malabar a good round oath is upon Perum&#257;l Iswaran, the
God of the shrine at K&#333;tiy&#363;r. In South Malabar it is common
to swear by Kodungall&#363;r Bhagavati, or by Guruvay&#363;r Appan,
local deities.</p>
<p>The Tand&#257;n is the principal person in the tara, to decide all
caste disputes. In South Malabar, he is, as a rule, appointed by the
senior R&#257;ni of the Zamorin. A fee of anything up to 101 fanams
(Rs. 25&ndash;4&ndash;0) must be paid to this lady, when she appoints a
Tand&#257;n. When there is a problem of any special difficulty, it is
referred to her for decision. In territories other than those within
the power of the Zamorin, the local R&#257;ja appoints the Tand&#257;n,
and gives the final decision in special cases. As we have seen, the
Tiyan is always to some extent subordinate to a N&#257;yar overlord,
but he is not bound to any particular one. He can go where he likes,
and reside anywhere, and is not bound to any particular chief, as is
the N&#257;yar. It is noted by General E. F. Burton,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1899src" href="#xd21e1899" name="xd21e1899src">26</a> in
connection with bygone days, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100"
href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>&ldquo;such was the insolent
pride of caste that the next (and very respectable) class of Hindus,
the Teers, were not allowed to come near the Nairs, under penalty of
being cut down by the sword, always naked and ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with the religion of the Tiyans, I may commence with
an old tradition, which is no doubt from a Br&#257;hmanic source. Once
upon a time there were seven heavenly damsels, who used to bathe every
day before dawn in a lake situated in a forest. Siva found this out,
and appeared as a fire on the bank, at which the girls warmed
themselves. Having thus lured them, the God made all of them mothers.
Seven beautiful boys were born, and Siva presented them to Parvati, who
treated them as if they were her own sons. They were taken to mount
Kail&#257;sa, and employed in preparing toddy for the mysterious and
wonderful Sakti worship. Daily they brought the toddy at the moment
when it was required for the golden pot. Parvati embraced the boys all
at once, and they became one. On a certain day, this boy sent the
sacred toddy in charge of a Br&#257;hman, who became curious to know
the virtues of the mysterious liquid. As he rested on a river bank
thinking about it, he drank a little, and filled the vessel up with
water. Then he reached Kail&#257;sa too late for the daily worship.
Siva was angry, and ordered the Saunika boy (Parvati&rsquo;s name for
him) to be brought before him. But the boy had been told what had
happened, and cut off the head of the Br&#257;hman, who had confessed
to him. Seeing the boy coming along carrying a Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s
head, Siva was astonished, and commanded him to approach nearer. The
boy explained that it was not a heinous crime to cut off the head of
one who had prevented the Sakti worship. Siva said that the killing of
a Br&#257;hman was the worst of crimes, and put the perpetrator out of
caste. He would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101"
name="pb101">101</a>]</span>not listen to the boy, who replied that
whoever prevented Sakti worship was a Chand&#257;la, and condemned him.
The boy asked for death at Siva&rsquo;s hands. The request pleased the
God, who forgave him. The boy had to remain out of caste, but was
initiated into the mysteries of Sakti worship as the surest means of
salvation, and to him was given the exclusive privilege of performing
Sakti worship with liquor. He was commanded to follow, and imitate the
Br&#257;hmans in everything, except in the matter of repeating the
sacred mantrams. By tantrams (signs with the hands) he eventually
obtained the merit of making p&#363;ja with mantrams. He was the first
Tiyan.</p>
<p>It is pretty safe to say that all the ideas of the Tiyans connected
with pure Hinduism&mdash;the Hinduism of the V&#275;das&mdash;and of
tradition, of which we see very little in Southern India, and which in
Malabar is more perverted in confused ideas than perhaps elsewhere,
those relating to re-birth, karma, pilgrimages to Benares and distant
temples are borrowed from the Br&#257;hmans. In the ceremonies which
have been described, notably in those connected with marriage and
death, we have seen the expression of many Hindu ideas. Not so is all
that relates to offerings to the dead. That is the common property of
all the children of men.</p>
<p>A main feature in the religion of the Tiyan is that it is largely
connected with Sakti worship. Some Br&#257;hmans indulge therein, but
they are unable, like the Tiyans, to use arrack in connection with it,
and are obliged to use, instead of this requisite, milk or honey. Siva,
not exactly a V&#275;dic entity, and Sakti, are supposed to be the two
primordial and eternal principles in nature. Sakti is, perhaps, more
properly the vital energy, and Sakti worship the worship of the life
principle in nature. We are not considering the abstract meaning of the
term <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>Sakti; nor are we now thinking of the Siva of
Monier Williams or Max M&uuml;ller. We are in Malabar, where the
Hinduism of the V&#275;das is in almost hopeless confusion, and mingled
with animism and nearly every other kind of primitive religious idea.
It is not therefore at all an easy task to represent in words anything
like a rational conception of what the religion of the Tiyan really is.
The poor and ignorant follow, in a blind ignorant way, Hinduism as they
know it and feel it. Their Hinduism is very largely imbued with the
lower cult, which, with a tinge of Hinduism, varied in extent here and
there, is really the religion of the people at large all over Southern
India. The Tiyans have a large share of it. To the actions of evil and
other spirits are attributable most, if not all of the ills and joys of
life. The higher Hinduism is far above them. Nevertheless, we find
among them the worship of the obscure and mysterious Sakti, which,
unfortunately, is practiced in secret. Nobody seems to be in the least
proud of having anything to do with it. In fact, they are rather
ashamed to say anything about it. Those who, so to speak, go in for it
are obliged to undergo preliminary purificatory ceremonies, before the
great mystery can be communicated to them. The mantram, which is
whispered by the guru (religious preceptor) in the ear of the devotee
is said to be &ldquo;Brahma aham, Vishnu aham, Bhairavu aham&rdquo; (I
am Brahma, I am Vishnu, I am Bhairavan). It is believed that each
individual is a spark of the divinity. Having in him the potentiality
of the Supreme Being, he can develop, and attain godhood. There is no
distinction of caste in Sakti worship. The devotees may belong to the
highest or to the lowest castes, though I doubt very much whether the
Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hmans indulge in it. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>The
novices, of whatever caste, eat and drink together during the period of
p&#363;ja. Men and women participate in the secret rites. A solemn oath
is taken that the mystery of Sakti will not be revealed, except with
the permission of the guru, or on the death-bed. The spirit of the
goddess (for Sakti is thought of as the female principle) must be
withdrawn from the body of the Sakti worshipper when he is at the point
of death. A lamp is lighted beside him. A few leaves of the tulsi plant
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Ocimum sanctum</i>), a little rice, and a lighted
wick are given to the dying man. Holding these things, he makes three
passes over his body from head to foot, and, as it were, transfers the
spirit to the next man, at the same time communicating his wishes about
continuing the worship, and so on. When a man dies before this
separation or transfer has been accomplished, a Br&#257;hman must be
called in, who, with a silver image representing the deceased, makes
symbolic transference of the Sakti spirit. It must be done somehow, or
the soul of the deceased cannot attain salvation. It is said that, like
many other things in this land, Sakti worship has undergone
degeneration, that such lofty ideas and feelings as may have once
pervaded it have more or less disappeared, and that the residue is not
very edifying. Be this as it may, in every tara there is a Bhagavati
temple for Tiyans, where Tiyans officiate as priests. The Komaram
(oracle) of the Bhagavati temple is clothed in red, and embellished
with red sandal paste mixed with turmeric. Bhagavati is always
associated with various jungle spirits or gods, whose Komarams always
wear black. There is no daily worship in Tiyan temples, with the
exception of a few in the neighbourhood of Cannanore. But there is an
annual celebration of p&#363;ja during the mannalam (forty day) period,
commencing on the first of the month <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>Vrischikam (15th
November). Lamps are lighted, and worship is begun on this day, and
continued for forty days. At its conclusion, the jungle gods retire to
the jungle until the next year. A death in the family of a Komaram
involves, I believe, some postponement of the rites. The period is
supposed to be first part of the functional activity of the earth,
which ends somewhere about the 21st of June. It is during this period
that Sakti worship is carried on.</p>
<p>The temple of Subramania at Palni in the Madura district is a
favourite objective for Tiyan pilgrims. The subject of pilgrimages to
this temple has been touched on in my note on the N&#257;yars
(<i>see</i> N&#257;yar). The Bhagavati temple at Kodungall&#363;r in
Cochin territory on the coast is another favourite place of pilgrimage
among the Tiyans. All classes of people, with the exception of
Br&#257;hmans, undertake this pilgrimage. Everyone under a vow,
proceeding to the festival, which takes place in February or March,
carries with him a cock, which is beheaded at the shrine. Under the
Perum&#257;ls, pilgrimage to Kodungall&#363;r was somewhat compulsory.
This temple was a fruitful source of revenue to the State, for not only
the Tiyans, but the fisherman and artisan castes had their own temple
in every tara in the land, and the M&#363;ppan&mdash;the
Komaram&mdash;of each temple was under an obligation to contribute
yearly gifts to the temple at Kodungall&#363;r. Rent for the temple
lands was set at a nominal figure&mdash;a mere pepper-corn rent as
acknowledgment of sovereign right. Rent might not be paid in times of
trouble, but the gifts eked out of superstition were unfailing. It is
not surprising, therefore, that learning and advancement among the
inferior castes did not receive much encouragement from the rulers of
those days. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>The temple of Kotiy&#363;r in North Malabar is also a shrine to
which Tiyans make pilgrimage. Indeed, it may be said that they follow
Hinduism generally in rather a low form, and that Sakti worship is
perhaps more peculiarly theirs than others&rsquo;, owing to their being
able to use arrack, a product of the palm, and therefore of their own
particular m&eacute;tier. The highest merit in Sakti can be reached
only through arrack. The Sakti goddess, Bhagavati, the Tiyans look upon
as their own guardian spirit.</p>
<p>As instancing the mixture and confusion of religious ideas in
Malabar, it may be mentioned that M&#257;ppillas have been known to
indulge in Sakti worship, and Tiyans to have made vows, and given
offerings at M&#257;ppilla mosques and Christian churches. Vows to the
well-known mosque at Mambram are made by people of almost every caste.
It is not uncommon to present the first fruit of a j&#257;k tree, or
the milk of a cow when it brings forth its first calf, to the local
Tangal or M&#257;ppilla priest.</p>
<p>In many, perhaps in most Tiyan houses, offerings are made annually
to a bygone personage named Kunnath N&#257;yar, and to his friend and
disciple Kunhi R&#257;yan, a M&#257;ppilla. It is probable that they
excelled in witchcraft and magic, but, according to the story, the
N&#257;yar worshipped the kite until he obtained command and control
over all the snakes in the land. The offerings are made in order to
prevent accidents from snakes. The snake god will also give children to
the family, and promote domestic prosperity. Men without offspring
worship him. Leprosy and the death of a child are believed to be the
consequence of killing a snake. There are M&#257;ppilla devotees of
Kunnath N&#257;yar and Kunhi R&#257;yan, who exhibit snakes in a box,
and collect alms. There is a snake mosque near Manargh&#257;t,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>at the foot of the N&#299;lgiri hills, which has
its annual festival. The alms are collected ostensibly for this
mosque.</p>
<p>An interesting story, which is the legendary account of the exodus
of the artisans from Malabar, and their return with the Tiyans, is
narrated by the P&#257;nans. There were, in olden times, five
recognised classes, which includes the &#256;s&#257;ris (carpenters),
Mus&#257;ris (workers in bell-metal), Thatt&#257;ns (goldsmiths), and
Perin-Kollans (blacksmiths). The fifth class is unknown. When an
individual of the artisan classes dies, the P&#257;nan of the tara must
bring a death gift to the house, which consists of cocoanuts and
j&#257;k fruits or plantains. The P&#257;nan places the gift in the
yard and repeats a long formula, which he has learnt by heart. It is
very likely that he knows little or nothing of its meaning. But he
reels it off, and at its conclusion the gifts are accepted. The same
formula is also always repeated among the carpenters, goldsmiths, and
blacksmiths during wedding and t&#257;li-tying ceremonies. It relates
how the artisans deserted the land of Ch&#275;raman Perum&#257;l, and
sought an asylum in the country of the Izhuvans with the island king,
and how the Perum&#257;l sent the P&#257;nan to bring them back. Every
one knows this old story, and believes it firmly. It must be learnt by
heart, and the P&#257;nan gives it in the yard when a member of the
artisan classes dies. The story is to the following effect. During the
four Yugams, Kreta, Treta, Dwapara, and K&#257;li, many kings reigned
over the earth. Parasu R&#257;man destroyed the Kshatriya kings on
twenty-one occasions, and was obliged to make atonement in expiatory
ceremonies. He worshipped Varuna, the ocean god, and recovered from the
sea a hundred and sixty k&#257;thams of land, consisting of
K&#333;lan&#257;d (?), V&#275;n&#257;d (Travancore), Kanya Kum&#257;ri
(Cape Comorin), Ch&#275;ran&#257;d, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>and Malay&#257;lam up
to Changala Vazhi beyond the Anaimalai hills. Ch&#275;raman
Per&#363;m&#257;l was the ruler of this land, in which were the four
castes. His capital was at Tiruvanja Kolam. One day,
Veluth&#275;dan<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1940src" href="#xd21e1940"
name="xd21e1940src">27</a> Chiraman was washing the
Perum&#257;l&rsquo;s cloths in a tank. He beat the cloths on a stone
which was flat on the ground, and held one of the cloths in his hand. A
girl of the carpenter caste, Ayyesvari by name, was just then going to
the tank to bathe after her monthly period. She called out &ldquo;Ho!
Kammal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1943src" href="#xd21e1943" name=
"xd21e1943src">28</a> That is not the way to wash cloths. Put a small
stone under one end of your washing stone, so as to make it slope a
little. Then hold both ends of the cloth in your hand, and beat the
middle of the cloth on the stone.&rdquo; The Veluth&#275;dan did so,
and found that he washed better, and the cloths were whiter. The
Perum&#257;l asked him &ldquo;Were you not washing the cloths before?
Who washed them to-day?&rdquo; <a id="xd21e1946" name=
"xd21e1946"></a>To which the Veluth&#275;dan replied &ldquo;Oh!
Tambur&#257;n (chief or lord), a carpenter girl instructed your slave
to-day how to wash cloths properly. May Perum&#257;l be pleased to
order the girl to be given to your slave as his wife.&rdquo;
Perum&#257;l then said &ldquo;To whatever caste she may belong, you may
take her by force, and will not lose your caste.&rdquo; Having received
the king&rsquo;s permission, Veluth&#275;dan Chiraman concealed himself
near the carpenter&rsquo;s house, and, when the girl opened the door to
sweep the yard at dawn, he seized her, and carried her off to his
house. Carpenter Sankaran of Tiruvanja Kalam went to the Perum&#257;l,
and complained that Veluth&#275;dan Kammal had carried away his
daughter, and disgraced him. He asked the Perum&#257;l whether he would
give him an armed guard to rescue her. To which the Perum&#257;l
replied &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108"
name="pb108">108</a>]</span>will not help either party with armed men.
You must fight it out among yourselves.&rdquo; Then the five classes of
artisans consulted one another, and made common cause. The P&#257;nans,
Perin Malayans, and Ch&#275;n (red) Koravans joined the artisans. The
Ven Thach&#257;ns, V&#275;lans, Paravans, V&#275;ttuvans, Kanisan
Panikars, and the P&#257;ndi Pulluvans of Vell&#257;lan&#257;d joined
the other side. There was war for twelve years. In the end, the
artisans were defeated. They said among themselves &ldquo;We have been
defeated by the fourteenth caste of Veluth&#275;dan N&#257;yar, who
carried away our daughter. Let us leave this country.&rdquo; So 7,764
families, with the women and children, tied up their mats, and left
Ch&#275;ram&#257;n Perum&#257;l&rsquo;s country, and went to Izhuva
land, which was beyond it. They went before the Izhuva king (island
king), and told him their story. Now Ch&#275;ram&#257;n Perum&#257;l
used to be shaved every fifteen days. When the barber (Velakathalavan)
was sent for, he came without his knife (razor), as his wife had buried
it. He said &ldquo;Oh! Tamburan, have mercy on your slave. Your
slave&rsquo;s knife was given to the blacksmith to be mended, and he
took it away with him. He gave me this piece of iron, saying &ldquo;If
you want the knife made ready for use, you must come to the Izhuva land
for it, and we will mend it on our return.&rdquo; So Perum&#257;l had
to go without shaving, and his hair grew like a Rishi&rsquo;s. As there
were neither carpenters nor smiths to make implements, agriculture was
almost at a standstill; and, as there were no goldsmiths, the
t&#257;li-tying ceremonies could not be performed. Nor could the
rice-giving ceremony be done, for want of the &ldquo;neck-rings.&rdquo;
Then Ch&#275;ram&#257;n Perum&#257;l obtained advice, and resolved to
send the Mann&#257;n (washerman of the Tiyans), who was included in the
fourteenth caste, and the P&#257;nan, who belonged to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>eleventh caste. The Perum&#257;l gave to each of
them a thousand fanams, and told them to go to the Izhuva country, and
bring back the Kamm&#257;lans (artisans). They wandered over various
countries, stopping wherever they found a house. The P&#257;nan, being
clever, was able to live by his wits, and spent no money of his own.
The Mann&#257;n, on the contrary, spent all his money. They passed
Ramap&#363;ri, and reached Trichivamp&#363;ri. Then the Mann&#257;n
asked the P&#257;nan for a loan, which was refused. On Friday at noon,
the Mann&#257;n left the P&#257;nan, saying &ldquo;The P&#257;nan is no
companion for the Mann&#257;n.&rdquo; He returned to the Perum&#257;l
and reported his failure, and the P&#257;nan&rsquo;s refusal to lend
him money. The P&#257;nan went on, crossing rivers, canals, and
ferries, and at last reached the Izhuva king&rsquo;s country. He
entered the reception hall. At that moment, the king&rsquo;s goldsmith,
who had just finished making a golden crown for him, had put it on his
own head, to test its suitability for wearing. The P&#257;nan thought
he was the king, and made obeisance to him. The Kamm&#257;lans
recognised him. He discovered his mistake too late, for he had
addressed the goldsmith as Tamburan. So, to this day, the P&#257;nans,
when addressing goldsmiths, say Tamburan. The P&#257;nan told the
Kamm&#257;lans of his mission, but they refused to return unless full
reparation was made for the abduction of the carpenter girl, and
certain social disabilities were removed. The 7,764 families of
Kamm&#257;lans asked the Izhuva king his advice, and he said that they
should not go away. So the Kamm&#257;lans sent the P&#257;nan back, and
gave him the following presents, in order to demonstrate to the
Perum&#257;l that they were in comfortable circumstances:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold valam-piri (a sort of string worn over the right shoulder);
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span></li>
<li>Silver edam-piri (a similar sort of string worn on the left
shoulder);</li>
<li>Gold netti-pattam (to be tied on the forehead);</li>
<li>Gold bracelet;</li>
<li>Gold ornament for the hair.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Kamm&#257;lans sent word to the Perum&#257;l that they would not
return, unless they were given a girl in place of the carpenter&rsquo;s
daughter, who had been abducted, and certain privileges were granted to
them. At the same time, they promised the P&#257;nan that they would
share their privileges with him, if he was successful. So the
P&#257;nan returned, and appeared before the Perum&#257;l, who asked
him where the Kamm&#257;lans were. The P&#257;nan removed his gold cap,
and put it under his arm, and replied that they were prosperous, and
not anxious to return. Saying so, he placed before the Perum&#257;l the
rich presents given by the Kamm&#257;lans, and told the king that they
would not return, unless they were given a girl and certain
concessions. The Perum&#257;l told the P&#257;nan to go back, and
invite the Kamm&#257;lans to return on their own terms. He said they
would catch the first girl they met on the way to his palace, and all
their demands were granted. The P&#257;nan arrived again in the Izhuva
country, and told the Kamm&#257;lans what the Perum&#257;l had said.
They went to the Izhuva king, and obtained his permission to return to
their own country. Then they caught an Izhuva boy, and confined him.
The king asked them why they did so. They replied that they had lived
for twelve years<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1968src" href="#xd21e1968"
name="xd21e1968src">29</a> as his subjects, and would never recognise
any other king, so they wanted the Izhuva boy to represent him. The
king consented. When they started, the boy began to cry. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>A
Nasr&#257;ni,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1973src" href="#xd21e1973"
name="xd21e1973src">30</a> by name Thomma (Thomas), was taken to
accompany and protect the boy. The Kamm&#257;lans travelled to their
own country, and appeared before Ch&#275;ram&#257;n Perum&#257;l. On
the way, they found a girl of the Variar caste plucking flowers, and
caught her by the hand. All the five classes claimed her. At last it
was resolved to unite her with the Izhuva boy, their Tand&#257;n, who
represented their king, and treat her as their sister.
Ch&#275;ram&#257;n Perum&#257;l confirmed his promise, and granted the
following privileges to the Kamm&#257;lans:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. To make ceilings for their houses.</p>
<p>2. To make upstairs houses to live in.</p>
<p>3. To put up single staircases, consisting of one pole, in which
notches are cut, or pegs are stuck alternately, for the feet.</p>
<p>4. To have a gate-house.</p>
<p>5. To perform the t&#257;li-tying ceremonies of their girls in a
booth having four posts or supports; to place within it, on a stool, a
looking-glass with a handle, and the R&#257;mayana; and to place a silk
cloth on the girl&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>6. To do arpu at the conclusion of the t&#257;li-tying ceremony
(Vel! Arpu! is yelled out by the boys).</p>
<p>7. To cook rice in copper vessels on occasions of marriage and other
ceremonies, and to serve sugar and pappadams at their feasts.</p>
<p>8. To hold the umbrella and taza (a sort of umbrella), which are
carried in front of processions.</p>
<p>9. To clap hands, and dance.</p>
<p>10. To keep milch-cows for their own use.</p>
<p>Permission was further granted for the Kamm&#257;lans to wear the
following ornaments. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112"
name="pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>1. Netti-pattam, worn on the forehead during the t&#257;li-tying
ceremony.</p>
<p>2. Ananthovi, a ear ornament named after Anandan, the endless, the
serpent on which Vishnu reposes. The serpent is sometimes represented
with its tail in its mouth, forming a circle, an endless figure.
Ananthovi is the central pendant of the ear-ring worn by Tiyan women
among their kathila (ordinary gold ear-rings). It resembles a serpent
in form. It is worn by men of the Tiyan and artisan castes on special
occasions.</p>
<p>3. Waist zone or girdle.</p>
<p>4. Bracelets.</p>
<p>5. Anklet with two knobs, formed of two pieces screwed together.</p>
<p>6. Puli-mothiram, or tiger&rsquo;s claws mounted in gold, worn by
children.</p>
<p>7. Podippu, a knot of cotton-thread at the end of the string on
which coins are hung as ornaments.</p>
<p>8. Kalanchi, a gold knob above the podippu, which represents a
flower.</p>
<p>9. Necklace.</p>
<p>10. Edakam and madkam-t&#257;li, neck ornaments, in one of which are
set twenty-one stones.</p>
<p>11. Cotton thread above the gold thread on the neck.</p>
<p>The Perum&#257;l conferred like privileges upon the family
(Tiruvarankath) of the P&#257;nan who brought back the Kamm&#257;lans.
He wore all his ornaments, and made his obeisance to the Perum&#257;l.
He had, however, taken off his gold cap. The Perum&#257;l said
&ldquo;What you have removed, let it be removed.&rdquo; So he lost the
privilege of wearing a gold cap. The Perum&#257;l blessed the
Kamm&#257;lans, and they returned to their villages. They made a
separate house for the Izhuva boy and the Variar <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>girl, and maintained them. The Izhuva boy, who
was the first Tiyan to come to Malabar, brought with him the cocoanut,
and retained the right to cultivate and use it. To this day, the people
of the serf castes&mdash;Cherumans, Kanakans, and the like&mdash;use
the word Varian when addressing Tiyans, in reference to their descent
from the Variar girl.</p>
<p>The orthodox number of classes of Kamm&#257;lans is five. But the
artisans do not admit the workers in leather as of their guild, and say
there are only four classes. According to them, the fifth class was
composed of the copper-smiths, who did not return to Malabar with the
others, but remained in Izhuva land. Nevertheless, they always speak of
themselves as the Aiyen kudi or five-house Kamm&#257;lans.</p>
<p>There is a variant of the legend of the exodus, told by the
&#256;s&#257;ris (carpenters), which is worth narrating. Their version
of the story is repeated among themselves, and not by the P&#257;nan,
at every marriage and t&#257;li-tying ceremony. They identify the
village of the Perum&#257;l&rsquo;s washerman as Kanipayy&#363;r. This
is the name of a Namb&#363;tiri&rsquo;s illam in the Pon&#257;ni
t&#257;luk of Malabar. The Namb&#363;tiri is, it may be mentioned,
considered to be the highest extant authority in architecture. Disputed
points relating to this subject are referred to him, and his decision
is final, and accepted by all carpenters and house-builders. The
washerman&rsquo;s stone is said to have been lying flat in the water.
The girl Ayyesvari was also of Kanipayy&#363;r, and was carried off as
in the former story. But there was no request for an armed guard to
rescue her. The Perum&#257;l was, instead, asked to make the washerman
marry her, and thus avoid disgrace. He consented to do so, and all the
7,764 families of the five classes of Kamm&#257;lans assembled for the
wedding. An <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>immense booth, supported on granite pillars, was
erected. The washerman and his party were fed sumptuously. But the
booth had been so constructed that it could be made to collapse
instantaneously. So the Kamm&#257;lans went quietly outside, and, at a
given signal, the booth collapsed, and crushed to death the washerman
and his friends. After this, the Kamm&#257;lans fled, and remained one
year, eight months and eleven days in the Izhuva country. Negotiations
were carried on through the Izhuva king, and the Kamm&#257;lans
returned under his guarantee that their demands would be complied with.
The Izhuva king sent his own men and the Nasr&#257;ni to the capital of
the Perum&#257;l. The story of the exodus and the return was inscribed
on granite stone with solemn rites, and in the presence of witnesses.
This was buried at the northern gate of the Tiruvanchakulam temple on
Friday, the eighth of the month of Kanni. It was resolved that, in any
case of doubt, the stone should be unearthed. And it was only after all
this had been done that the Izhuva king&rsquo;s envoy returned to him.
Then the Kamm&#257;lans came back to Malabar. According to the
carpenters, the copper-smiths did not return. They say that eighteen
families of &#256;s&#257;ris remained behind. Some of these returned
long afterwards, but they were not allowed to rejoin the caste. They
are known as Puzhi Tachan, or sand carpenters, and Patinettanmar, or
the eighteen people. There are four families of this class now living
at or near Parpangadi. They are carpenters, but the &#256;s&#257;ris
treat them as outcastes.</p>
<p>There is yet another variant of the story of the exodus, which is
obviously of recent manufacture, for a Pattar Br&#257;hman is brought
in, and gives cunning advice. We know that the Pattars are
comparatively new comers in Malabar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Tiyans have recently been summed up as follows.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2039src" href="#xd21e2039" name=
"xd21e2039src">31</a> &ldquo;The Tiyas have always been characterised
by their persevering and enterprising habits. A large percentage of
them are engaged in various agricultural pursuits, and some of the most
profitable industries of Malabar have from time out of mind been in
their hands. They are exclusively engaged in making toddy and
distilling arrack. Many of them are professional weavers, the Malabar
mundu being a common kind of cloth made by them. The various industries
connected with cocoanut cultivation are also successfully carried on by
the Tiyas. For example, the manufacture of jaggery (crude sugar) is an
industry in which a considerable number of the Tiyas are profitably
engaged. The preparation of coir from cocoanut fibre is one of their
hereditary occupations, and this is done almost wholly by their women
at home. They are very skilful in the manufacture of coir matting and
allied industries. Commercial pursuits are also common among them.
Apart from their agricultural and industrial inclinations, the Tiyas
give evidence of a literary taste, which is commendable in a people who
are living under conditions which are anything but conducive to
literary life. They have among them good Sanskrit scholars, whose
contributions have enriched the Malay&#257;lam literature; physicians
well versed in Hindu systems of medicine; and well-known astrologers,
who are also clever mathematicians. In British Malabar, they have made
considerable progress in education. In recent years, there has been
gaining ground among the Tiyas a movement, which has for its object the
social and material improvement of the community. Their leaders have
very rightly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>given a prominent place to industry in their
schemes of progress and reform. Organisations for the purpose of
educating the members of the community on the importance of increased
industrial efforts have been formed. The success which has attended the
Industrial Exhibition conducted by the members of the community at
Quilon, in 1905, has induced them to make it a permanent annual event.
Some of their young men have been sent to Japan to study certain
industries, and, on their return, they hope to resuscitate the dying
local industries, and to enter into fresh fields of industry awaiting
development. Factories for the manufacture of coir matting and allied
articles have been established by the Tiyas in some parts of Travancore
and Cochin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1906, the foundation stone of a Tiya temple at Tellicherry was
laid with great ceremony. In the following year, a very successful
Industrial Exhibition was held at Cannanore under the auspices of the
Sri Narayan Dharma Paripalana Yogam. Still more recently, it was
resolved to collect subscriptions for the establishment of a hostel for
the use of Tiya youths who come from other places to Tellicherry for
educational purposes.</p>
<p><b>Tiy&#333;ro.</b>&mdash;The Tiy&#333;ros are described, in the
Madras Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;Oriya fishermen, who also make
lotus-leaf platters. They have four endogamous sections, viz., Torai,
Ghodai, Artia, and Kulodondia.&rdquo; It has been suggested that the
caste name is a corruption of the Sanskrit tivara, a hunter.
(<i>See</i> Risley, Tribes and Castes of Bengal, Tiyar.)</p>
<p><b>Toda.</b>&mdash;Quite recently, my friend Dr. W. H. Rivers, as
the result of a prolonged stay on the N&#299;lgiris, has
published<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2058src" href="#xd21e2058" name=
"xd21e2058src">32</a> an exhaustive account of the sociology and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>religion of this exceptionally interesting
tribe, numbering, according to the latest census returns, 807
individuals, which inhabits the N&#299;lgiri plateau. I shall,
therefore, content myself with recording the rambling notes made by
myself during occasional visits to Ootacamund and Paik&#257;ra,
supplemented by extracts from the book just referred to, and the
writings of Harkness and other pioneers of the N&#299;lgiris.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2064width" id="pl7-117"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">Toda buffaloes in kraal.</p>
</div>
<p>The Todas maintain a large-horned race of semi-domesticated
buffaloes, on whose milk and its products (butter and ney)<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2070src" href="#xd21e2070" name=
"xd21e2070src">33</a> they still depend largely, though to a less
extent than in bygone days before the establishment of the Ootacamund
bazar, for existence. It has been said that &ldquo;a Toda&rsquo;s
worldly wealth is judged by the number of buffaloes he owns. Witness
the story in connection with the recent visit to India of His Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales. A clergyman, who has done mission work
among the Todas, generally illustrates Bible tales through the medium
of a magic-lantern. One chilly afternoon, the Todas declined to come
out of their huts. Thinking they required humouring like children, the
reverend gentleman threw on the screen a picture of the Prince of
Wales, explaining the object of his tour, and, thinking to impress the
Todas, added &lsquo;The Prince is exceedingly wealthy, and is bringing
out a retinue of two hundred people.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo;
said an old man, wagging his head sagely, &lsquo;but how many buffaloes
is he bringing?<span class="corr" id="xd21e2073" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Todas lead for the most part a simple pastoral life. But I have
met with more than one man who had served, or who was still serving
Government in the modest capacity of a forest guard, and I have heard
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>others who had been employed, not with
conspicuous success, on planters&rsquo; estates. The Todas consider it
beneath their dignity to cultivate land. A former Collector of the
N&#299;lgiris granted them some acres of land for the cultivation of
potatoes, but they leased the land to the Badagas, and the privilege
was cancelled. In connection with the Todas&rsquo; objection to work,
it is recorded that when, on one occasion, a mistake about the
ownership of some buffaloes committed an old Toda to jail, it was found
impossible to induce him to work with the convicts, and the
authorities, unwilling to resort to hard remedies, were compelled to
save appearances by making him an overseer. The daily life of a Toda
woman has been summed up as lounging about the mad or mand (Toda
settlement), buttering and curling her hair, and cooking. The women
have been described as free from the ungracious and menial-like
timidity of the generality of the sex in the plains. When Europeans
(who are greeted as sw&#257;mi or god) come to a mand, the women crawl
out of their huts, and chant a monotonous song, all the time clamouring
for tips (in&#257;m). Even the children are so trained that they
clamour for money till it is forthcoming. As a rule, the Todas have no
objection to Europeans entering into their huts, but on more than one
occasion I have been politely asked to take my boots off before
crawling in on the stomach, so as not to desecrate the dwelling-place.
Writing in 1868, Dr. J. Shortt makes a sweeping statement that
&ldquo;most of the women have been debauched by Europeans, who, it is
sad to observe, have introduced diseases to which these innocent tribes
were once strangers, and which are slowly but no less surely sapping
their once hardy and vigorous constitutions. The effects of
intemperance and disease (syphilis) combined are becoming more and more
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>apparent in the shaken and decrepit appearance
which at the present day these tribes possess.&rdquo; Fact it
undoubtedly is, and proved both by hospital and naked-eye evidence,
that syphilis has been introduced among the Todas by contact with the
outside world, and they attribute the stunted growth of some members of
the rising generation, as compared with the splendid physique of the
lusty veterans, to the results thereof. It is an oft-repeated statement
that the women show an absence of any sense of decency in exposing
their naked persons in the presence of strangers. In connection with
the question of the morality of the Toda women, Dr. Rivers writes that
&ldquo;the low sexual morality of the Todas is not limited in its scope
to the relations within the Toda community. Conflicting views are held
by those who know the Nilgiri hills as to the relations of the Todas
with the other inhabitants, and especially with the train of natives
which the European immigration to the hills has brought in its wake.
The general opinion on the hills is that, in this respect, the morality
of the Todas is as low as it well could be, but it is a question
whether this opinion is not too much based on the behaviour of the
inhabitants of one or two villages [<i>e.g.</i>, the one commonly known
as School or Sylk&rsquo;s mand] near the European settlements, and I
think it is probable that the larger part of the Todas remain more
uncontaminated than is generally supposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I came across one Toda who, with several other members of the tribe,
was selected on account of fine physique for exhibition at
Barnum&rsquo;s show in Europe, America and Australia some years ago,
and still retained a smattering of English, talking fondly of
&lsquo;Shumbu&rsquo; (the elephant Jumbo). For some time after his
return to his hill abode, a tall white hat was the admiration of his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>fellow tribesmen. To this man finger-prints came
as no novelty, since his impressions were recorded both in England and
America.</p>
<p>Writing in 1870,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2091src" href=
"#xd21e2091" name="xd21e2091src">34</a> Colonel W. Ross King stated
that the Todas had just so much knowledge of the speech of their
vassals as is demanded by the most ordinary requirements. At the
present day, a few write, and many converse fluently in Tamil. The
N&#299;lgiri C.M.S. Tamil mission has extended its sphere of work to
the Todas, and I cannot resist the temptation to narrate a Toda version
of the story of Dives and Lazarus. The English say that once upon a
time a rich man and a poor man died. At the funeral of the rich man,
there was a great tam&#257;sha (spectacle), and many buffaloes were
sacrificed. But, for the funeral of the poor man, neither music nor
buffaloes were provided. The English believe that in the next world the
poor man was as well off as the rich man; so that, when any one dies,
it is of no use spending money on the funeral ceremonies. Two mission
schools have been established, one at Ootacamund, the other near
Paik&#257;ra. At the latter I have seen a number of children of both
sexes reading elementary Tamil and English, and doing simple
arithmetic.</p>
<p>A few years ago a Toda boy was baptised at Tinnevelly, and remained
there for instruction. It was hoped that he would return to the hills
as an evangelist among his people.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2096src"
href="#xd21e2096" name="xd21e2096src">35</a> In 1907, five young Toda
women were baptised at the C.M.S. Mission chapel, Ootacamund.
&ldquo;They were clothed in white, with a white cloth over their heads,
such as the Native Christians wear. A number of Christian Badagas had
assembled to witness the ceremony, and join in the service.&rdquo;

<p>The typical Toda man is above medium height, well proportioned and
stalwart, with leptorhine nose, regular features, and perfect teeth.
The nose is, as noted by Dr. Rivers, sometimes distinctly rounded in
profile. An attempt has been made to connect the Todas with the lost
tribes; and, amid a crowd of them collected together at a funeral,
there is no difficulty in picking out individuals, whose features would
find for them a ready place as actors on the Ober Ammergau stage,
either in leading or subordinate parts. The principal characteristic,
which at once distinguishes the Toda from the other tribes of the
N&#299;lgiris, is the development of the pilous (hairy) system. The
following is a typical case, extracted from my notes. Beard luxuriant,
hair of head parted in middle, and hanging in curls over forehead and
back of neck. Hair thickly developed on chest and abdomen, with median
strip of dense hairs on the latter. Hair thick over upper and lower
ends of shoulder-blades, thinner over rest of back; well developed on
extensor surface of upper arms, and both surfaces of forearms; very
thick on extensor surfaces of the latter. Hair abundant on both
surfaces of legs; thickest on outer side of thighs and round knee-cap.
Dense beard-like mass of hair beneath gluteal region (buttocks).
Superciliary brow ridges very prominent. Eyebrows united across middle
line by thick tuft of hairs. A dense growth of long straight hairs
directed outwards on helix of both ears, bearing a striking resemblance
to the hairy development on the helix of the South Indian bonnet monkey
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Macacus sinicus</i>). The profuse hairy development
is by some Todas attributed to their drinking &ldquo;too much
milk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2106width" id="pl7-121"><img src=
"images/pl7-121.jpg" alt="Toda." width="551" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Toda.</p>
</div>
<p>Nearly all the men have one or more raised cicatrices, forming
nodulous growths (keloids) on the right shoulder.These scars are
produced by burning the skin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>with red-hot sticks of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Lits&aelig;a Wightiana</i> (the sacred fire-stick). The
Todas believe that the branding enables them to milk the buffaloes with
perfect ease, or as Dr. Rivers puts it, that it cures the pain caused
by the fatigue of milking. &ldquo;The marks,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are
made when a boy is about twelve years old, at which age he begins to
milk the buffaloes.&rdquo; About the fifth month of a woman&rsquo;s
first pregnancy, on the new-moon day, she goes through a ceremony, in
which she brands herself, or is branded by another woman, by means of a
rag rolled up, dipped in oil and lighted, with a dot on the
carpo-metacarpal joint of each thumb and on each wrist.</p>
<p>The women are lighter in colour than the men, and the colour of the
body has been aptly described as of a <i>caf&eacute;-au-lait</i> tint.
The skin of the female children and young adults is often of a warm
copper hue. Some of the young women, with their raven-black hair
dressed in glossy ringlets, and bright glistening eyes, are distinctly
good-looking, but both good looks and complexion are short-lived, and
the women speedily degenerate into uncomely hags. As in Maori land, so
in Toda land, one finds a race of superb men coupled to hideous women,
and, with the exception of the young girls, the fair sex is the male
sex. Both men and women cover their bodies with a white mantle with
blue and red lines, called putk&#363;li, which is purchased in the
Ootacamund bazar, and is sometimes decorated with embroidery worked by
the Toda women. The odour of the person of the Todas, caused by the
rancid butter which they apply to the mantle as a preservative reagent,
or with which they anoint their bodies, is quite characteristic. With a
view to testing his sense of smell, long after our return from Paikara,
I blindfolded a friend who had accompanied me thither, and presented
before his nose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123"
name="pb123">123</a>]</span>a cloth, which he at once recognised as
having something to do with the Todas.</p>
<p>In former times, a Badaga could be at once picked out from the other
tribes of the N&#299;lgiri plateau by his wearing a turban. At the
present day, some Toda elders and important members of the community
(<i>e.g.</i>, monegars or headmen) have adopted this form of head-gear.
The men who were engaged as guides by Dr. Rivers and myself donned the
turban in honour of their appointment.</p>

<p>Toda females are tattooed after they have reached puberty. I have
seen several multipar&aelig;, in whom the absence of tattoo marks was
explained either on the ground that they were too poor to afford the
expense of the operation, or that they were always suckling or
pregnant&mdash;conditions, they said, in which the operation would not
be free from danger. The dots and circles, of which the simple devices
are made up,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2137src" href="#xd21e2137"
name="xd21e2137src">36</a> are marked out with lamp-black made into a
paste with water, and the pattern is pricked in by a Toda woman with
the spines of <i lang="la-x-bio">Berberis aristata</i>. The system of
tattooing and decoration of females with ornaments is summed up in the
following cases:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Aged 22. Has one child. Tattooed with three dots on back of left
hand. Wears silver necklet ornamented with Arcot two-anna pieces;
thread and silver armlets ornamented with cowry (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Cypr&aelig;a moneta</i>) shells on right upper arm; thread
armlet ornamented with cowries on left forearm; brass ring on left ring
finger; silver rings on right middle and ring fingers. Lobes of ears
pierced. Ear-rings removed owing to grandmother&rsquo;s death.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>2. Aged 28. Tattooed with a single dot on chin; rings and dots on
chest, outer side of upper arms, back of left hand, below calves, above
ankles, and across dorsum of feet. Wears thread armlet ornamented with
young cowries on right forearm; thread armlet and two heavy ornamental
brass armlets on left upper arm; ornamental brass bangle and glass bead
bracelet on left wrist; brass ring on left little finger; two steel
rings on left ring finger; bead necklet ornamented with cowries.</p>
<p>3. Aged 35. Tattooed like the preceding, with the addition of an
elaborate device of rings and dots on the back.</p>
<p>4. Aged 35. Linen bound round elbow joint, to prevent chafing of
heavy brass armlets. Cicatrices of sores in front of elbow joint,
produced by armlets.</p>
<p>5. Aged 23. Has one child. Tattooed only below calves, and above
ankles.</p>
<p>The following are the more important physical measurements of the
Toda men, whom I have examined:&mdash;</p>

<p>A thing of exceeding joy to the Todas was my Salter&rsquo;s
hand-dynamometer, the fame of which spread from mand to mand, and which
was circulated among the crowd at funerals. Great was the disgust of
the assembled males, on a certain day, when the record of hand-grip for
the morning (73 lbs.) was carried off by a big-boned female, who became
the unlovely heroine of the moment. The largest English feminine
hand-grip, recorded in my laboratory note-book, is only 66 lbs. One
Toda man, of fine physique, not satisfied with his grip of 98 lbs.,
went into training, and fed himself up for a few days. Thus prepared,
he returned to accomplish 103 lbs., the result of more skilful
manipulation of the machine rather than of a liberal dietary of
butter-milk.</p>
<p>The routine Toda dietary is said to be made up of the following
articles, to which must be added strong drinks purchased at the toddy
shops:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Rice boiled in whey.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Rice and jaggery (crude sugar) boiled in water.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Broth or curry made of vegetables purchased in the bazar,
wild vegetables and pot-herbs, which, together with ground orchids, the
Todas may often be seen rooting up with a sharp-pointed digging-stick
on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>the hill-sides. The Todas scornfully deny the
use of aphrodisiacs, but both men and women admit that they take
s&#257;lep misri boiled in milk, to make them strong. S&#257;lep misri
is made from the tubers (testicles de chiens) of various species of
<i lang="la-x-bio">Eulophia</i> and <i lang="la-x-bio">Habenaria</i>
belonging to the natural order Orchide&aelig;.</p>
<p>The indigenous edible plants and pot-herbs include the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i lang="la-x-bio">Cnicus Wallichii</i> (thistle).&mdash;The
roots and flower-stalks are stripped of their bark, and made into soup
or curry.</p>
<p>(2) <i lang="la-x-bio">Girardinia heterophylla</i> (N&#299;lgiri
nettle).&mdash;The tender leafy shoots of vigorously growing plants are
gathered, crushed by beating with a stick to destroy the stinging
hairs, and made into soup or curry. The fibre of this plant, which is
cultivated near the mands, is used for stitching the putkuli, with
steel needles purchased in the bazar in lieu of the more primitive
form. In the preparation of the fibre, the bark is thrown into a pot of
boiling water, to which ashes have been added. After a few hours&rsquo;
boiling, the bark is taken out and the fibre extracted.</p>
<p>(3) Tender shoots of bamboos eaten in the form of curry.</p>

<p>A list containing the botanical and Toda names of trees, shrubs,
etc., used by the Todas in their ordinary life, or in their ceremonial,
is given by Dr. Rivers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2498src" href=
"#xd21e2498" name="xd21e2498src">38</a></p>
<p>Fire is, in these advanced days, obtained by the Todas in their
dwelling huts for domestic purposes from matches. The men who came to
be operated on with my measuring instruments had no hesitation in
asking for a match, and lighting the cheroots which were distributed
amongst them, before they left the Paik&#257;ra bungalow dining-room.
Within the precincts of the dairy temple the use of matches is
forbidden, and fire is kindled with the aid of two dry sticks of
<i lang="la-x-bio">Lits&aelig;a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128"
href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>Wightiana</i>. Of these one,
terminating in a blunt convex extremity, is about 2&prime; 3&Prime;
long; the other, with a hemispherical cavity scooped out close to one
end, about 2&frac12;&Prime; in length. A little nick or slot is cut on
the edge of the shorter stick, and connected with the hole in which the
spindle stick is made to revolve. &ldquo;In this slot the dust
collects, and, remaining in an undisturbed heap, seemingly acts as a
muffle to retain the friction-heat until it reaches a sufficiently high
temperature, when the wood-powder becomes incandescent.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2512src" href="#xd21e2512" name=
"xd21e2512src">39</a> Into the cavity in the short stick the end of the
longer stick fits, so as to allow of easy play. The smaller stick is
placed on the ground, and held tight by firm pressure of the great toe,
applied to the end furthest from the cavity, into which a little finely
powdered charcoal is inserted. The larger stick is then twisted
vigorously, &ldquo;like a chocolate muller&rdquo; (Tylor) between the
palms of the hands by two men, turn and turn about, until the charcoal
begins to glow. Fire, thus made, is said to be used at the sacred dairy
(ti), the dairy houses of ordinary mands, and at the cremation of
males. In an account of a Toda green funeral,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2515src" href="#xd21e2515" name="xd21e2515src">40</a> Mr.
Walhouse notes that &ldquo;when the pile was completed, fire was
obtained by rubbing two dry sticks together. This was done mysteriously
and apart, for such a mode of obtaining fire is looked upon as
something secret and sacred.&rdquo; At the funeral of a female, I
provided a box of t&auml;ndstickors for lighting the pyre. A
fire-stick, which was in current use in a dairy, was polluted and
rendered useless by the touch of my Br&#257;hman assistant! It is
recorded by Harkness<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2518src" href=
"#xd21e2518" name="xd21e2518src">41</a> that a Br&#257;hman was not
only refused <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>admission to a Toda dairy, but actually driven
away by some boys, who rushed out of it when they heard him approach.
It is noted by Dr. Rivers that &ldquo;several kinds of wood are used
for the fire-sticks, the Toda names of these being kiaz or keadj
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Lits&aelig;a Wightiana</i>), m&#333;rs (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Michelia Nilagirica</i>), parskuti (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">El&aelig;agnus latifolia</i>), and main (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Cinnamomum Wightii</i>).&rdquo; He states further that,
&ldquo;whenever fire is made for a sacred purpose, the fire-sticks must
be of the wood which the Todas call kiaz or keadj, except in the
tesherot ceremony (qualifying ceremony for the office of palol) in
which the wood of muli is used. At the niroditi ceremony (ordination
ceremony of a dairyman), &ldquo;the assistant makes fire by friction,
and lights a fire of mulli wood, at which the candidate warms
himself.&rdquo; It is also recorded by Dr. Rivers that &ldquo;in some
Toda villages, a stone is kept, called tutm&ucirc;kal, which was used
at one time for making fire by striking it with a piece of
iron.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2537width" id="pl7-129"><img src=
"images/pl7-129.jpg" alt="Toda hut." width="720" height="526">
<p class="figureHead">Toda hut.</p>
</div>
<p>The abode of the Todas is called a mad or mand (village or hamlet),
which is composed of huts, dairy temple, and cattle-pen, and has been
so well described by Dr. Shortt,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2543src"
href="#xd21e2543" name="xd21e2543src">42</a> that I cannot do better
than quote his account. &ldquo;Each mand,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;usually comprises about five buildings or huts, three of which
are used as dwellings, one as a dairy, and the other for sheltering the
calves at night. These huts form a peculiar kind of oval pent-shaped
[half-barrel-shaped] construction, usually 10 feet high, 18 feet long,
and 9 feet broad. The entrance or doorway measures 32 inches in height
and 18 inches in width, and is not provided with any door or gate; but
the entrance is closed by means of a solid slab or plank of wood from 4
to 6 inches thick, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130"
name="pb130">130</a>]</span>and of sufficient dimensions to entirely
block up the entrance. This sliding door is inside the hut, and so
arranged and fixed on two stout stakes buried in the earth, and
standing to the height of 2&frac12; to 3 feet, as to be easily moved to
and fro. There are no other openings or outlets of any kind, either for
the escape of smoke, or for the free ingress and egress of atmospheric
air. The doorway itself is of such small dimensions that, to effect an
entrance, one has to go down on all fours, and even then much wriggling
is necessary before an entrance is effected. The houses are neat in
appearance, and are built of bamboos closely laid together, fastened
with rattan, and covered with thatch, which renders them water-tight.
Each building has an end walling before and behind, composed of solid
blocks of wood, and the sides are covered in by the pent-roofing, which
slopes down to the ground. The front wall or planking contains the
entrance or doorway. The inside of a hut is from 8 to 15 feet square,
and is sufficiently high in the middle to admit of a tall man moving
about with comfort. On one side there is a raised platform or pial
formed of clay, about two feet high, and covered with s&#257;mbar
(deer) or buffalo skins, or sometimes with a mat. This platform is used
as a sleeping place. On the opposite side is a fire place, and a slight
elevation, on which the cooking utensils are placed. In this part of
the building, faggots of firewood are seen piled up from floor to roof,
and secured in their place by loops of rattan. Here also the
rice-pounder or pestle is fixed. The mortar is formed by a hole dug in
the ground, 7 to 9 inches deep, and hardened by constant use. The other
household goods consist of three or four brass dishes or plates,
several bamboo measures, and sometimes a hatchet. Each hut or dwelling
is surrounded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>by an enclosure or wall formed of loose stones
piled up two or three feet high [with openings too narrow to permit of
a buffalo entering through it]. The dairy is sometimes a building
slightly larger than the others, and usually contains two compartments
separated by a centre planking. One part of the dairy is a store-house
for ghee, milk and curds, contained in separate vessels. The outer
apartment forms the dwelling place of the dairy priest. The doorways of
the dairy are smaller than those of the dwelling huts. The flooring of
the dairy is level, and at one end there is a fire-place. Two or three
milk pails or pots are all that it usually contains. The dairy is
usually situated at some little distance from the habitations. The huts
where the calves are kept are simple buildings, somewhat like the
dwelling huts. In the vicinity of the mands are the cattle-pens or
tuels[tu], which are circular enclosures surrounded by a loose stone
wall, with a single entrance guarded by powerful stakes. In these, the
herds of buffaloes are kept at night. Each mand possesses a herd of
these animals.&rdquo; It is noted by Dr. Rivers that &ldquo;in the
immediate neighbourhood of a village there are usually well-worn paths,
by which the village is approached, and some of these paths or kalvol
receive special names. Some may not be traversed by women. Within the
village there are also certain recognised paths, of which two are
specially important. One, the punetkalvol, is the path by which the
dairy man goes from his dairy to milk or tend the buffaloes; the other
is the majvatitthkalvol, the path which the women must use when going
to the dairy to receive butter-milk (maj) from the dairy man. Women are
not allowed to go to the dairy or to other places connected with it,
except at appointed times, when they receive buttermilk.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>In addition to the dairies which in form resemble the dwelling-huts,
the Todas keep up as dairy-temples certain curious conical edifices, of
which there are said to be four on the N&#299;lgiri plateau, viz., at
the Muttan&#257;d mand, near Kotagiri, near Shol&#363;r, and at
Mudimand. The last was out of repair a few years ago, but was, I was
informed, going to be rebuilt shortly. It is suggested by Dr. Rivers as
probable that in many cases a dairy, originally of the conical form,
has been rebuilt in the same form as the dwelling-hut, owing to the
difficulty and extra labour of reconstruction in the older shape. The
edifice at the Muttan&#257;d mand (or N&#333;drs), at the top of the
S&#299;g&#363;r gh&#257;t, is known to members of the Ootacamund Hunt
as the Toda cathedral. It has a circular stone base and a tall conical
thatched roof crowned with a large flat stone, and is surrounded by a
circular stone wall. To penetrate within the sacred edifice was
forbidden, but we were informed that it contained milking vessels,
dairy apparatus, and a sw&#257;mi in the guise of a copper bell (mani).
The dairyman is known as the varzhal or wursol. In front of the
cattle-pen of the neighbouring mand, I noticed a grass-covered mound,
which, I was told, is sacred. The mound contains nothing buried within
it, but the bodies of the dead are placed near it, and earth from the
mound is placed on the corpse before it is removed to the
burning-ground. At &ldquo;dry funerals&rdquo; the buffalo is said to be
slain near the mound. It has been suggested by Colonel
Marshall<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2554src" href="#xd21e2554" name=
"xd21e2554src">43</a> that the &ldquo;boa or boath [poh.] is not a true
Toda building, but may be the bethel of some tribe contemporaneous
with, and cognate to the Todas, which, taking refuge, like them, on
these hills, died out in their presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the hypothesis of Dr. Rivers that the Todas are derived from
one or more of the races of Malabar, their origin is buried among the
secrets of the past. So too is the history of the ancient builders of
cairns and barrows on the N&#299;lgiri plateau, which were explored by
Mr. Breeks when Commissioner of the N&#299;lgiris.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2565src" href="#xd21e2565" name="xd21e2565src">44</a> The bulk
of the Breeks&rsquo; collection is now preserved in the Madras Museum,
and includes a large series of articles in pottery, quite unlike
anything known from other parts of Southern India. Concerning this
series, Mr. R. Bruce Foote writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2568src" href="#xd21e2568" name="xd21e2568src">45</a> &ldquo;The
most striking objects are tall jars, many-storied cylinders, of varying
diameter with round or conical bases, fashioned to rest upon pottery
ring-stands, or to be stuck into soft soil, like the amphor&aelig; of
classical times. These jars were surmounted by domed lids. On these
lids stood or sat figures of the most varied kind of men, or animals,
much more rarely of inanimate objects, but all modelled in the rudest
and most grotesque style. Grotesque and downright ugly as are these
figures, yet those representing men and women are extremely interesting
from the light they throw upon the stage of civilization their makers
had attained to, for they illustrate the fashion of the garments as
also of the ornaments they wore, and of the arms or implements carried
by them. The animals they had domesticated, those they chased, and
others that they probably worshipped, are all indicated. Many figures
of their domestic animals, especially their buffaloes and sheep, are
decorated with garlands and bells, and show much ornamentation, which
seems to indicate that they were painted over, a custom which yet
prevails in many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134"
name="pb134">134</a>]</span>parts.&rdquo; Among the most interesting
figures are those of heavily bearded men riding on horses, and
big-horned buffaloes which might have been modelled from the Toda
buffaloes of to-day, and, like these, at funerals and migration
ceremonies, bear a bell round the neck.</p>
<p>Two forms of Toda dairy have so far been noticed. But there remains
a third kind, called the ti mand, concerning which Dr. Rivers writes as
follows. &ldquo;The ti is the name of an institution, which comprises a
herd of buffaloes, with a number of dairies and grazing districts,
tended by a dairy-man priest called palol, with an assistant called
kaltmokh. Each dairy, with its accompanying buildings and pasturage, is
called a ti mad, or ti village. The buffaloes belonging to a ti are of
two kinds, distinguished as persiner and punir. The former are the
sacred buffaloes, and the elaborate ceremonial of the ti dairy is
concerned with their milk. The punir correspond in some respects to the
putiir of the ordinary village dairy, and their milk and its products
are largely for the personal use and profit of the palol, and are not
treated with any special ceremony. During the whole time he holds
office, the palol may not visit his home or any other ordinary village,
though he may visit another ti village. Any business with the outside
world is done either through the kaltmokh, or with people who come to
visit him at the ti. If the palol has to cross a river, he may not pass
by a bridge, but must use a ford, and it appears that he may only use
certain fords. The palol must be celibate, and, if married, he must
leave his wife, who is in most cases also the wife of his brother or
brothers.&rdquo; I visited the ti mand near Paik&#257;ra by
appointment, and, on arrival near the mand, found the two palols,
well-built men aged about thirty and fifty, clad in black cloths, and
two kaltmokhs, youths aged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href=
"#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>about eight and ten, naked save
for a loin-cloth, seated on the ground, awaiting our arrival. As a mark
of respect to the palols, the three Todas who accompanied me arranged
their putk&#363;lis so that the right arm was laid bare, and one of
them, who was wearing a turban, removed it. A long palaver ensued in
consequence of the palols demanding ten rupees to cover the expenses of
the purificatory ceremonies, which, they maintained, would be necessary
if I desecrated the mand by photographing it. Eventually, however,
under promise of a far smaller sum, the dwelling-hut was photographed,
with palols, kaltmokhs, and a domestic cat seated in front of it.</p>
<p>In connection with the palol being forbidden to cross a river by a
bridge, it may be noted that the river which flows past the
Paik&#257;ra bungalow is regarded as sacred by the Todas, and, for fear
of mishap from arousing the wrath of the river god, a pregnant Toda
woman will not venture to cross it. The Todas will not use the river
water for any purpose, and they do not touch it unless they have to
ford it. They then walk through it, and, on reaching the opposite bank,
bow their heads. Even when they walk over the Paik&#257;ra bridge, they
take their hand out of the putk&#363;li as a mark of respect.
Concerning the origin of the Paik&#257;ra river, a grotesque legend was
narrated to us. Many years ago, the story goes, two Todas, uncle and
nephew, went out to gather honey. After walking for a few miles they
separated, and proceeded in different directions. The uncle was
unsuccessful in the search, but the more fortunate nephew secured two
kandis (bamboo measures) of honey. This, with a view to keeping it all
for himself, he secreted in a crevice among the rocks, with the
exception of a very small quantity, which he made his uncle believe was
the entire product of his search. On the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>following day, the
nephew went alone to the spot where the honey was hidden, and found, to
his disappointment, that the honey was leaking through the bottom of
the bamboo measures, which were transformed into two snakes. Terrified
at the sight thereof, he ran away, but the snakes pursued him (may be
they were hamadryads, which have the reputation of pursuing human
beings). After running a few minutes, he espied a hare (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Lepus nigricollis</i>) running across his course, and, by a
skilful man&oelig;uvre, threw his body-cloth over it. Mistaking it for
a man, the snakes followed in pursuit of the hare, which, being very
fleet of foot, managed to reach the sun, which became obscured by the
hoods of the reptiles. This fully accounts for the solar eclipse. The
honey, which leaked out of the vessels, became converted into the
Paik&#257;ra river.</p>
<p>In connection with the migrations of the herds of buffaloes, Dr.
Rivers writes as follows. &ldquo;At certain seasons of the year, it is
customary that the buffaloes both of the village and the ti should
migrate from one place to another. Sometimes the village buffaloes are
accompanied by all the inhabitants of the village; sometimes the
buffaloes are only accompanied by their dairy-man and one or more male
assistants. There are two chief reasons for these movements of the
buffaloes, of which the most urgent is the necessity for new
grazing-places.... The other chief reason for the migrations is that
certain villages and dairies, formerly important and still sacred, are
visited for ceremonial purposes, or out of respect to ancient
custom.&rdquo; For the following note on a buffalo migration which he
came across, I am indebted to Mr. H. C. Wilson. &ldquo;During the
annual migration of buffaloes to the Kundahs, and when they were
approaching the bridle-path leading from <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>Avalanch&#275; to
Sisp&#257;ra, I witnessed an interesting custom. The Toda family had
come to a halt on the far side of the path; the females seated
themselves on the grass, and awaited the passing of the sacred herd.
This herd, which had travelled by a recognised route across country,
has to cross the bridle-path some two or three hundred yards above the
Avalanch&#275;-Sisp&#257;ra sign-post. Both the ordinary and sacred
herd were on the move together. The former passed up the Sisp&#257;ra
path, while the latter crossed in a line, and proceeded slightly down
the hill, eventually crossing the stream and up through the sh&#333;las
over the steep hills on the opposite side of the valley. As soon as the
sacred herd had crossed the bridle-path, the Toda men, having put down
all their household utensils, went to where the women and girls were
sitting, and carried them, one by one, over the place where the
buffaloes had passed, depositing them on the path above. One of the men
told me that the females are not allowed to walk over the track covered
by the sacred herd, and have to be carried whenever it is necessary to
cross it. This herd has a recognised tract when migrating, and is led
by the old buffaloes, who appear to know the exact way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tenure under which lands are held by the Todas is summed up as
follows by Mr. R. S. Benson in his report on the revenue settlement of
the Nilgiris, 1885. &ldquo;The earliest settlers, and notably Mr.
Sullivan, strongly advocated the claim of the Todas to the absolute
proprietary right to the plateau [as lords of the soil]; but another
school, led by Mr. Lushington, has strongly combated these views, and
apparently regarded the Todas as merely occupiers under the ryotwari
system in force generally in the Presidency. From the earliest times
the Todas have received from the cultivating Badagas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>an
offering or tribute, called gudu or basket of grain, partly in
compensation for the land taken up by the latter for cultivation, and
so rendered unfit for grazing purposes, but chiefly as an offering to
secure the favour, or avert the displeasure of the Todas, who, like the
Kurumbas (<i>q.v.</i>), are believed by the Badagas to have necromantic
powers over their health and that of their herds. The European settlers
also bought land in Ootacamund from them, and to this day the
Government pays them the sum of Rs. 150 per mensem, as compensation for
interference with the enjoyment of their pastoral rights in and about
Ootacamund. Their position was, however, always a matter of dispute,
until it was finally laid down in the despatch of the Court of
Directors, dated 21st January, 1843. It was then decided that the Todas
possessed nothing more than a prescriptive right to enjoy the privilege
of pasturing their herds, on payment of a small tax, on the State
lands. The Court desired that they should be secured from interference
by settlers in the enjoyment of their mands, and of their spots
appropriated to religious rites. Accordingly pattas were issued,
granting to each mand three bullahs (11.46 acres) of land. In 1863 Mr.
Grant obtained permission to make a fresh allotment of nine bullahs
(34.38 acres) to each mand on the express condition that the land
should be used for pasturage only, and that no right to sell the land
or the wood on it should be thereby conveyed. It may be added that the
so-called Toda lands are now regarded as the inalienable common
property of the Toda community, and unauthorised alienation is checked
by the imposition of a penal rate of assessment (G.O., 18th April
1882). Up to the date of this order, however, alienations by sale or
lease were of frequent occurrence. It remains to be seen whether
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>the present orders and subordinate staff will be
more adequate than those that went before to check the practices
referred to.&rdquo; With the view of protecting the Toda lands,
Government took up the management of these lands in 1893, and framed
rules, under the Forest Act, for their management, the rights of the
Todas over them being in no way affected by the rules of which the
following is an abstract:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. No person shall fell, girdle, mark, lop, uproot, or burn, or
strip off the bark or leaves from, or otherwise damage any tree growing
on the said lands, or remove the timber, or collect the natural produce
of such trees or lands, or quarry or collect stone, lime, gravel, earth
or manure upon such lands, or break up such lands for cultivation, or
erect buildings of any description, or cattle kraals; and no person or
persons, other than the Todas named in the patta concerned, shall graze
cattle, sheep, or goats upon such lands, unless he is authorised so to
do by the Collector of Nilgiris, or some person empowered by him.</p>
<p>2. The Collector may select any of the said lands to be placed under
special fire protection.</p>
<p>3. No person shall hunt, beat for game, or shoot in such lands
without a license from the Collector.</p>
<p>4. No person shall at any time set nets, traps, or snares for game
on such lands.</p>
<p>5. All Todas in the Nilgiri district shall, in respect of their own
patta lands, be exempt from the operation of the above rules, and shall
be at liberty to graze their own buffaloes, to remove fuel and grass
for their domestic requirements, and to collect honey or wax upon such
lands. They shall likewise be entitled to, and shall receive free
permits for building or repairing their mands and temples. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>6. The Collector shall have power to issue annual permits for the
cultivation of grass land only in Toda pattas by Todas themselves, free
of charge, or otherwise as Government may, from time to time, direct;
but no Toda shall be at liberty to permit any person, except a Toda, to
cultivate, or assist in the cultivation of such lands.</p>
<p>In 1905, the Todas petitioned Government against the prohibition by
the local Forest authorities of the burning of grass on the downs,
issued on the ground of danger to the sh&#333;las (wooded ravines or
groves). This yearly burning of the grass was claimed by the Todas to
improve it, and they maintained that their cattle were deteriorating
for want of good fodder. Government ruled that the grass on the plateau
has been burnt by the inhabitants at pleasure for many years without
any appreciable damage to forest growth, and the practice should not be
disturbed.</p>
<p>Concerning the social organisation of the Todas, Mr. Breeks states
that they are &ldquo;divided into two classes, which cannot intermarry,
viz., D&ecirc;valy&acirc;l and Tarserzh&acirc;l. The first class
consists of Peiki class, corresponding in some respects to
Br&#257;hmans; the second of the four remaining classes the Pekkan,
Kuttan, Kenna, and Todi. A Peiki woman may not go to the village of the
Tarserzh&acirc;l, although the women of the latter may visit
Peikis.&rdquo; The class names given by Mr. Breeks were readily
recognised by the Todas whom I interviewed, but they gave
T&#275;rth&#257;l (comprising superior Peikis) and T&#257;rth&#257;l as
the names of the divisions. They told me that, when a T&#275;rth&#257;l
woman visits her friends at a T&#257;rth&#257;l mand, she is not
allowed to enter the mand, but must stop at a distance from it. Todas
as a rule cook their rice in butter-milk, but, when a T&#275;rth&#257;l
woman pays a visit to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href=
"#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>Tarth&#257;l mand, rice is cooked
for her in water. When a Tarth&#257;l woman visits at a
T&#275;rth&#257;l mand, she is permitted to enter into the mand, and
food is cooked for her in buttermilk. The restrictions which are
imposed on T&#275;rth&#257;l women are said to be due to the fact that
on one occasion a T&#275;rth&#257;l woman, on a visit at a Tarth&#257;l
mand, folded up a cloth, and placed it under her putk&#363;li as if it
was a baby. When food was served, she asked for some for the child, and
on receiving it, exhibited the cloth. The Tarth&#257;ls, not
appreciating the mild joke, accordingly agreed to degrade all
T&#275;rth&#257;l women. According to Dr. Rivers, &ldquo;the
fundamental feature of the social organisation is the division of the
community into two perfectly distinct groups, the Tartharol and the
Teivaliol [=D&ecirc;valy&acirc;l of Breeks]. There is a certain amount
of specialisation of function, certain grades of the priesthood being
filled only by members of the Teivaliol. The Tartharol and Teivaliol
are two endogamous divisions of the Toda people. Each of these primary
divisions is sub-divided into a number of secondary divisions [clans].
These are exogamous. Each class possesses a group of villages, and
takes its name from the chief of these villages, Etudmad. The Tartharol
are divided into twelve clans, the Teivaliol into six clans or
madol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a girl has reached the age of puberty, she goes through an
initiatory ceremony, in which a Toda man of strong physique takes part.
One of these splendid specimens of human muscularity was introduced to
me on the occasion of a phonograph recital at the Paik&#257;ra
bungalow.</p>
<p>Concerning the system of polyandry as carried out by the Todas, Dr.
Rivers writes as follows. &ldquo;The Todas have long been noted as a
polyandrous people, and the institution of polyandry is still in full
working order <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>among them. When the girl becomes the wife of a
boy, it is usually understood that she becomes also the wife of his
brothers. In nearly every case at the present time, and in recent
generations, the husbands of a woman are own brothers. In a few cases,
though not brothers, they are of the same clan. Very rarely do they
belong to different clans. One of the most interesting features of Toda
polyandry is the method by which it is arranged who shall be regarded
as the father of a child. For all social and legal purposes, the father
of a child is the man who performs a certain ceremony about the seventh
month of pregnancy, in which an imitation bow and arrow are given to
the woman. When the husbands are own brothers, the eldest brother
usually gives the bow and arrow, and is the father of the child,
though, so long as the brothers live together, the other brothers are
also regarded as fathers. It is in the cases in which the husbands are
not own brothers that the ceremony becomes of real social importance.
In these cases, it is arranged that one of the husbands shall give the
bow and arrow, and this man is the father, not only of the child born
shortly afterwards, but also of all succeeding children, till another
husband performs the essential ceremony. Fatherhood is determined so
essentially by this ceremony that a man who has been dead for several
years is regarded as the father of any children born by his widow, if
no other man has given the bow and arrow. There is no doubt that, in
former times, the polyandry of the Todas was associated with female
infanticide, and it is probable that the latter custom still exists to
some extent, though strenuously denied. There is reason to believe that
women are now more plentiful than formerly, though they are still in a
distinct minority. Any increase, however, in the number of women does
not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>appear to have led to any great diminution of
polyandrous marriages, but polyandry is often combined with polygyny.
Two or more brothers may have two or more wives in common. In such
marriages, however, it seems to be a growing custom that one brother
should give the bow and arrow to one wife, and another brother to
another wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pregnancy ceremony referred to above is called pursutpimi, or
bow (and arrow) we touch. According to the account given to me by
several independent witnesses, the woman proceeds, accompanied by
members of the tribe, on a new moon-day in the fifth or seventh month
of her pregnancy, to a shola, where she sits with the man who is to
become the father of her child near a kiaz tree (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Eugenia Arnottiana</i>). The man asks the father of the
woman if he may bring the bow, and, on obtaining his consent, goes in
search of a shrub (<i lang="la-x-bio">Sophora glauca</i>), from a twig
of which he makes a mimic bow. The arrow is represented by a blade of
grass called nark (<i lang="la-x-bio">Andropogon
Sch&oelig;nanthus</i>). Meanwhile a triangular niche has been cut in
the kiaz tree, in which a lighted lamp is placed. The woman seats
herself in front of the lamp, and, on the return of the man, asks
thrice &ldquo;Whose bow is it?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
meaning to whom, or to which mand does the child belong? The bow and
arrow are handed to the woman, who raises them to her head, touches her
forehead with them, and places them near the tree. From this moment the
lawful father of the child is the man from whom she has received the
bow and arrow. He places on the ground at the foot of the tree some
rice, various kinds of grain, chillies, jaggery (crude sugar), and salt
tied in a cloth. All those present then leave, except the man and
woman, who remain near the tree till about six o&rsquo;clock in the
evening, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>when they return to the mand. The time is
determined, in the vicinity of Ootacamund, by the opening of the
flowers of <i lang="la-x-bio">Onothera tetraptera</i> (evening
primrose), a garden escape called by the Todas &#257;ru mani p&#363;v
(six o&rsquo;clock flower), which opens towards evening.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2648src" href="#xd21e2648" name=
"xd21e2648src">46</a> It may be noted that, at the second funeral of a
male, a miniature bow and three arrows are burnt with various other
articles within the stone circle (azaram).</p>
<p>A few years ago (1902), the Todas, in a petition to Government,
prayed for special legislation to legalise their marriages on the lines
of the Malabar Marriage Act. The Government was of opinion that
legislation was unnecessary, and that it was open to such of the Todas
as were willing to sign the declaration prescribed by section 10 of the
Marriage Act III of 1872 to contract legal marriages under the
provision of that Act. The Treasury Deputy Collector of the
N&#299;lgiris was appointed Registrar of Toda marriages. No marriage
has been registered up to the present time.</p>
<p>The practice of infanticide among the Todas is best summed up in the
words of an aged Toda during an interview with Colonel
Marshall.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2655src" href="#xd21e2655" name=
"xd21e2655src">47</a> &ldquo;I was a little boy when Mr. Sullivan (the
first English pioneer of the Nilgiris) visited these mountains. In
those days it was the custom to kill children, but the practice has
long died out, and now one never hears of it. I don&rsquo;t know
whether it was wrong or not to kill them, but we were very poor, and
could not support our children. Now every one has a mantle (putkuli),
but formerly there was only one for the whole family. We did not kill
them to please any god, but because it was our custom. The mother never
nursed the child, and the parents did <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>not kill it. Do you
think we could kill it ourselves? Those tell lies who say we laid it
down before the opening of the buffalo-pen, so that it might be run
over and killed by the animals. We never did such things, and it is all
nonsense that we drowned it in buffalo&rsquo;s milk. Boys were never
killed&mdash;only girls; not those who were sickly and
deformed&mdash;that would be a sin; but, when we had one girl, or in
some families two girls, those that followed were killed. An old woman
(kelachi) used to take the child immediately it was born, and close its
nostrils, ears, and mouth with a cloth thus&mdash;here pantomimic
action. It would shortly droop its head, and go to sleep. We then
buried it in the ground. The kelachi got a present of four annas for
the deed.&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s remark about the cattle-pen refers
to the Malagasy custom of placing a new-born child at the entrance to a
cattle-pen, and then driving the cattle over it, to see whether they
would trample on it or not.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2661src" href=

<p>At the census, 1901, 453 male and 354 female Todas were returned. In
a note on the proportion of the sexes among the Todas, Mr. R. C.
Punnett states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2674src" href="#xd21e2674"
name="xd21e2674src">50</a> that &ldquo;all who have studied the Todas
are agreed upon the frequency of the practice (of infanticide) in
earlier times. Marshall, writing in 1872, refers to the large amount of
female infanticide in former years, but expresses his conviction that
the practice had by that time died out. Marshall&rsquo;s evidence is
that of native assurance only. Dr. Rivers, who received the same
assurance, is disinclined to place much confidence in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>native veracity with reference to this point,
and, in view of the lack of encouragement which the practice receives
from the Indian Government, this is not altogether surprising. The
supposition of female infanticide, by accounting for the great
disproportion in the numbers of the sexes, brings the Todas into
harmony with what is known of the rest of mankind.&rdquo; In
summarising his conclusions, Mr. Punnett notes that:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Among the Todas, males predominate greatly over females.</p>
<p>(2) This preponderance is doubtless due to the practice of female
infanticide, which is probably still to some extent prevalent.</p>
<p>(3) The numerical preponderance of the males has been steadily
sinking during recent years, owing probably to the check which foreign
intercourse has imposed upon female infanticide.</p>
<p>In connection with the death ceremonies of the Todas, Dr. Rivers
notes that &ldquo;soon after death the body is burnt, and the general
name for the ceremony on this occasion is etvainolkedr, the first day
funeral. After an interval, which may vary greatly in length, a second
ceremony is performed, connected with certain relics of the deceased
which have been preserved from the first occasion. The Toda name for
this second funeral ceremony is marvainolkedr, the second day funeral,
or &lsquo;again which day funeral.&rsquo; The funeral ceremonies are
open to all, and visitors are often invited by the Todas. In
consequence, the funeral rites are better known, and have been more
frequently described than any other features of Toda ceremonial. Like
nearly every institution of the Todas, however, they have become known
to Europeans under their Badaga names. The first funeral is called by
the Badagas hase kedu, the fresh or green <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>funeral, and the term
&lsquo;green funeral&rsquo; has not only become the generally
recognised name among the European inhabitants of the Nilgiri hills,
but has been widely adopted in anthropological literature. The second
funeral is called by the Badagas bara kedu, the &lsquo;dry
funeral,&rsquo; and this term also has been generally adopted.&rdquo;
The various forms of the funeral ceremonies are discussed in detail by
Dr. Rivers, and it must suffice to describe those at which we have been
present as eye-witnesses.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity of witnessing the second funeral of a woman
who had died from smallpox two months previously. On arrival at a mand
on the open downs about five miles from Ootacamund, we were conducted
by a Toda guide to the margin of a dense shola, where we found two
groups seated apart, consisting of (<i>a</i>) women, girls, and
brown-haired female babies, round a camp fire; (<i>b</i>) men, boys,
and male babies, carried, with marked signs of paternal affection, by
their fathers. In a few minutes a murmuring sound commenced in the
centre of the female group. Working themselves up to the necessary
pitch, some of the women (near relatives of the deceased) commenced to
cry freely, and the wailing and lachrymation gradually spread round the
circle, until all, except little girls and babies who were too young to
be affected, were weeping and mourning, some for fashion, others from
genuine grief. In carrying out the orthodox form of mourning, the women
first had a good cry to themselves, and then, as their emotions became
more intense, went round the circle, selecting partners with whom to
share companionship in grief. Gradually the group resolved itself into
couplets of mourners, each pair with their heads in contact, and giving
expression to their emotions in unison. Before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>separating to select a new partner, each couple
saluted by bowing the head, and raising thereto the feet of the other,
covered by the putk&#363;li. [I have seen women rapidly recover from
the outward manifestations of grief, and clamour for money.] From time
to time the company of mourners was reinforced by late arrivals from
distant mands, and, as each detachment, now of men and now of women,
came in view across the open downs, one could not fail to be reminded
of the gathering of the clans on some Highland moor. The resemblance
was heightened by the distant sound as of pipers, produced by the Kota
band (with two police constables in attendance), composed of four
Kotas, who made a weird noise with drums and flutes as they drew near
the scene of action. The band, on arrival, took up a position close to
the mourning women. As each detachment arrived, the women, recognising
their relatives, came forward and saluted them in the manner customary
among Todas by falling at their feet, and placing first the right and
then the left foot on their head. Shortly after the arrival of the
band, signals were exchanged, by waving of putk&#363;lis, between the
assembled throng and a small detachment of men some distance off. A
general move was made, and an <i>impromptu</i> procession formed, with
men in front, band in the middle, and women bringing up the rear. A
halt was made opposite a narrow gap leading into the shola; men and
women sat apart as before; and the band walked round, discoursing
unsweet music. A party of girls went off to bring fire from the spot
just vacated for use in the coming ceremonial, but recourse was finally
had to a box of matches lent by one of our party. At this stage we
noticed a woman go up to the eldest son of the deceased, who was seated
apart from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>other men, and would not be comforted in spite
of her efforts to console him. On receipt of a summons from within the
shola, the assembled Toda men and ourselves swarmed into it by a narrow
track leading to a small clear space round a big tree, from a hole cut
at the base of which an elderly Toda produced a piece of the skull of
the dead woman, wrapped round with long tresses of her hair. It now
became the men&rsquo;s turn to exhibit active signs of grief, and all
of one accord commenced to weep and mourn. Amid the scene of
lamentation, the hair was slowly unwrapt from off the skull, and burned
in an iron ladle, from which a smell as of incense arose. A bamboo pot
of gh&#299; was produced, with which the skull was reverently anointed,
and placed in a cloth spread on the ground. To this relic of the
deceased the throng of men, amid a scene of wild excitement, made
obeisance by kneeling down before it, and touching it with their
foreheads. The females were not permitted to witness this stage of the
proceedings, with the exception of one or two near relatives of the
departed one, who supported themselves sobbing against the tree. The
ceremonial concluded, the fragment of skull, wrapt in the cloth, was
carried into the open, where, as men and boys had previously done,
women and girls made obeisance to it. A procession was then again
formed, and marched on until a place was reached, where were two
stone-walled kraals, large and small. Around the former the men, and
within the latter the women, took up their position, the men engaging
in chit-chat, and the women in mourning, which after a time ceased, and
they too engaged in conversation. A party of men, carrying the skull,
still in the cloth, set out for a neighbouring shola, where a k&#275;du
of several other dead Todas was being celebrated; and a long
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>pause ensued, broken eventually by the arrival
of the other funeral party, the men advancing in several lines, with
arms linked, and crying out U, hah! U, hah, hah! in regular time. This
party brought with it pieces of the skulls of a woman and two men,
which were placed, wrapt in cloths, on the ground, saluted, and mourned
over by the assembled multitude. At this stage a small party of Kotas
arrived, and took up their position on a neighbouring hill, waiting,
vulture-like, for the carcase of the buffalo which was shortly to be
slain. Several young men now went off across the hill in search of
buffaloes, and speedily re-appeared, driving five buffaloes before them
with sticks. As soon as the beasts approached a swampy marsh at the
foot of the hill on which the expectant crowd of men was gathered
together, two young men of athletic build, throwing off their
putk&#363;lis, made a rush down the hill, and tried to seize one of the
buffaloes by the horns, with the result that one of them was promptly
thrown. The buffalo escaping, one of the remaining four was quickly
caught by the horns, and, with arms interlocked, the men brought it
down on its knees, amid a general scuffle. In spite of marked objection
and strenuous resistance on the part of the animal&mdash;a barren
cow&mdash;it was, by means of sticks freely applied, slowly dragged up
the hill, preceded by the Kota band, and with a Toda youth pulling at
its tail. Arrived at the open space between the kraals, the buffalo, by
this time thoroughly exasperated, and with blood pouring from its
nostrils, had a cloth put on its back, and was despatched by a blow on
the poll with an axe deftly wielded by a young and muscular man. On
this occasion no one was badly hurt by the sacrificial cow, though one
man was seen washing his legs in the swamp after the preliminary
struggle with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>the beast. But Colonel Ross-King narrates how he
saw a man receive a dangerous wound in the neck from a thrust of the
horn, which ripped open a wide gash from the collar-bone to the ear.
With the death of the buffalo, the last scene, which terminated the
strange rites, commenced; men, women, and children pressing forward and
jostling one another in their eagerness to salute the dead beast by
placing their hands between its horns, and weeping and mourning in
pairs; the facial expression of grief being mimicked when tears refused
to flow spontaneously.</p>
<p>The ceremonial connected with the final burning of the relics and
burial of the ashes at the stone circle (azaram) are described in
detail by Dr. Rivers.</p>
<p>A few days after the ceremony just described, I was invited to be
present at the funeral of a young girl who had died of smallpox five
days previously. I proceeded accordingly to the scene of the recent
ceremony, and there, in company with a small gathering of Todas from
the neighbouring mands, awaited the arrival of the funeral
cort&eacute;ge, the approach of which was announced by the advancing
strains of Kota music. Slowly the procession came over the brow of the
hill; the corpse, covered by a cloth, on a rude ladder-like bier, borne
on the shoulders of four men, followed by two Kota musicians; the
mother carried hidden within a sack; relatives and men carrying bags of
rice and jaggery, and bundles of wood of the kiaz tree (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Eugenia Arnottiana</i>) for the funeral pyre. Arrived
opposite a small hut, which had been specially built for the
ceremonial, the corpse was removed from the bier, laid on the ground,
face upwards, outside the hut, and saluted by men, women, and children,
with the same manifestations of grief as on the previous occasion. Soon
the men moved away to a short distance, and engaged <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>in
quiet conversation, leaving the females to continue mourning round the
corpse, interrupted from time to time by the arrival of detachments
from distant mands, whose first duty was to salute the dead body.
Meanwhile a near female relative of the dead child was busily engaged
inside the hut, collecting together in a basket small measures of rice,
jaggery, sago, honey-comb, and the girl&rsquo;s simple toys, which were
subsequently to be burned with the corpse. The mourning ceasing after a
time, the corpse was placed inside the hut, and followed by the near
relatives, who there continued to weep over it. A detachment of men and
boys, who had set out in search of the buffaloes which were to be
sacrificed, now returned driving before them three cows, which escaped
from their pursuers to rejoin the main herd. A long pause ensued, and,
after a very prolonged drive, three more cows were guided into a marshy
swamp, where one of them was caught by the horns, and dragged
reluctantly, but with little show of fight, to the strains of Kota drum
and flute, in front of the hut, where it was promptly despatched by a
blow on the poll. The corpse was now brought from within the hut, and
placed, face upwards, with its feet resting on the forehead of the
buffalo, whose neck was decorated with a silver chain, such as is worn
by Todas round the loins, as no bell was available, and the horns were
smeared with butter. Then followed frantic manifestations of grief,
amid which the unhappy mother fainted. Mourning over, the corpse was
made to go through a form of ceremony, resembling that which is
performed during pregnancy with the first child. A small boy, three
years old, was selected from among the relatives of the dead girl, and
taken by his father in search of a certain grass (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Andropogon Sch&oelig;nanthus</i>) and a twig of a shrub
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>(<i lang="la-x-bio">Sophora glauca</i>), which
were brought to the spot where the corpse was lying. The mother of the
dead child then withdrew one of its hands from the putk&#363;li, and
the boy placed the grass and twig in the hand, and limes, plantains,
rice, jaggery, honey-comb, and butter in the pocket of the
putk&#363;li, which was then stitched with needle and thread in a
circular pattern. The boy&rsquo;s father then took off his son&rsquo;s
putk&#363;li, and replaced it so as to cover him from head to foot.
Thus covered, the boy remained outside the hut till the morning of the
morrow, watched through the night by near relatives of himself and his
dead bride. [On the occasion of the funeral of an unmarried lad, a girl
is in like manner selected, covered with her putk&#363;li from head to
foot, and a metal vessel filled with jaggery, rice, etc., to be
subsequently burnt on the funeral pyre, placed for a short time within
the folds of the putk&#363;li. Thus covered, the girl remains till next
morning, watched through the dreary hours of the night by relatives.
The same ceremony is performed over the corpse of a married woman who
has not borne children, the husband acting as such for the last time,
in the vain hope that the woman may produce issue in heaven.] The
corpse was borne away to the burning-ground within the shola, and,
after removal of some of the hair by the mother of the newly wedded
boy, burned, with face upwards, amid the music of the Kota band, the
groans of the assembled crowd squatting on the ground, and the genuine
grief of the nearest relatives. The burning concluded, a portion of the
skull was removed from the ashes, and handed over to the recently made
mother-in-law of the dead girl, and wrapped up with the hair in the
bark of the t&#363;d tree (<i lang="la-x-bio">Meliosma pungens</i>). A
second buffalo, which, properly speaking, should have been slain before
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>the corpse was burnt, was then sacrificed, and
rice and jaggery were distributed among the crowd, which dispersed,
leaving behind the youthful widower and his custodians, who, after
daybreak, partook of a meal of rice, and returned to their mands; the
boy&rsquo;s mother taking with her the skull and hair to her mand,
where it would remain until the celebration of the second funeral. No
attention is paid to the ashes after cremation, and they are left to be
scattered by the winds.</p>
<p>A further opportunity offered itself to be present at the funeral of
an elderly woman on the open downs not far from Paik&#257;ra, in
connection with which certain details possess some interest. The corpse
was, at the time of our arrival, laid out on a rude bier within an
improvised arbour covered with leaves and open at each end, and tended
by some of the female relatives. At some little distance, a conclave of
Toda men, who rose of one accord to greet us, was squatting in a
circle, among whom were many venerable white-turbaned elders of the
tribe, protected from the scorching sun by palm-leaf umbrellas. Amid
much joking, and speech-making by the veterans, it was decided that, as
the eldest son of the deceased woman was dead, leaving a widow, this
daughter-in-law should be united to the second son, and that they
should live together as man and wife. On the announcement of the
decision, the bridegroom-elect saluted the principal Todas present by
placing his head on their feet, which were sometimes concealed within
the ample folds of the putk&#363;li. At the funeral of a married woman,
three ceremonies must, I was told, be performed, if possible, by a
daughter or daughter-in-law, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Tying a leafy branch of the tiviri shrub (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Atylosia Candolleana</i>) in the putk&#363;li of the corpse;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p>(2) Tying balls of thread and cowry shells on the arm of the corpse,
just above the elbow;</p>
<p>(3) Setting fire to the funeral pyre, which was, on the present
occasion, done by lighting a rag fed with gh&#299; with a match.</p>
<p>The buffalo capture took place amid the usual excitement, and with
freedom from accident; and, later in the day, the stalwart buffalo
catchers turned up at the travellers&rsquo; bungalow for a
<i>pourboire</i> in return, as they said, for treating us to a good
fight. The beasts selected for sacrifice were a full-grown cow and a
young calf. As they were dragged near to the corpse, now removed from
the arbour, butter was smeared over the horns, and a bell tied round
the neck. The bell was subsequently removed by Kotas, in whose custody,
it was said, it was to remain till the next day funeral. The
death-blow, or rather series of blows, having been delivered with the
butt end of an axe, the feet of the corpse were placed at the mouth of
the buffalo. In the case of a male corpse, the right hand is made to
clasp the horns. [It is recorded by Dr. Rivers that, at the funeral of
a male, men dance after the buffalo is killed. In the dancing a tall
pole, called tadri or tadrsi, decorated with cowry shells, is used.]
The customary mourning in couples concluded, the corpse, clad in four
cloths, was carried on the stretcher to a clear space in the
neighbouring shola, and placed by the side of the funeral pyre, which
had been rapidly piled up. The innermost cloth was black in colour, and
similar to that worn by a palol. Next to it came a putk&#363;li
decorated with blue and red embroidery, outside which again was a plain
white cloth covered over by a red cotton cloth of European manufacture.
Seated by the side of the pyre, near to which I was courteously invited
to take a seat on the stump of a rhododendron, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>was
an elderly relative of the dead woman, who, while watching the
ceremonial, was placidly engaged in the manufacture of a holly
walking-stick with the aid of a glass scraper. The proceedings were
watched on behalf of Government by a forest guard, and a police
constable who, with marked affectation, held his handkerchief to his
nose throughout the ceremonial. The corpse was decorated with brass
rings, and within the putk&#363;li were stowed jaggery, a scroll of
paper adorned with cowry shells, snuff and tobacco, cocoanuts,
biscuits, various kinds of grain, gh&#299;, honey, and a tin-framed
looking-glass. A long purse, containing a silver Japanese yen and an
Arcot rupee of the East India Company, was tied up in the putk&#363;li
close to the feet. These preliminaries concluded, the corpse was
hoisted up, and swung three times over the now burning pyre, above
which a mimic bier, made of slender twigs, was held. The body was then
stripped of its jewelry, and a lock of hair cut off by the
daughter-in-law for preservation, together with a fragment of the
skull. I was told that, when the corpse is swung over the pyre, the
dead person goes to amnodr (the world of the dead). In this connection,
Dr. Rivers writes that &ldquo;it would seem as if this ceremony of
swinging the body over the fire was directly connected with the removal
of the objects of value. The swinging over the fire would be symbolic
of its destruction by fire; and this symbolic burning has the great
advantage that the objects of value are not consumed, and are available
for use another time. This is probably the real explanation of the
ceremony, but it is not the explanation given by the Todas themselves.
They say that long ago, about 400 years, a man supposed to be dead was
put on the funeral pyre, and, revived by the heat, he was found to be
alive, and was able to walk away from the funeral place. In consequence
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>of this, the rule was made that the body should
always be swung three times over the fire before it is finally placed
thereon.&rdquo; [Colonel Marshall narrates the story that a Toda who
had revived from what was thought his death-bed, has been observed
parading about, very proud and distinguished looking, wearing the
finery with which he had been bedecked for his own funeral, and which
he would be permitted to carry till he really departed this life.] As
soon as the pyre was fairly ablaze, the mourners, with the exception of
some of the female relatives, left the sh&#333;la, and the men,
congregating on the summit of a neighbouring hill, invoked their god.
Four men, seized, apparently in imitation of the Kota D&#275;v&#257;di,
with divine frenzy, began to shiver and gesticulate wildly, while
running blindly to and fro with closed eyes and shaking fists. They
then began to talk in Malay&#257;lam, and offer an explanation of an
extraordinary phenomenon, which had appeared in the form of a gigantic
figure, which disappeared as suddenly as it appeared. At the annual
ceremony of walking through fire (hot ashes) in that year, two factions
arose owing to some dissension, and two sets of ashes were used. This
seems to have annoyed the gods, and those concerned were threatened
with speedy ruin. But the whole story was very vague. The possession by
some Todas of a smattering of Malay&#257;lam is explained by the fact
that, when grazing their buffaloes on the northern and western slopes
of the N&#299;lgiris, they come in contact with Malay&#257;lam-speaking
people from the neighbouring Malabar district.</p>
<p>At the funeral of a man (a leper), the corpse was placed in front of
the entrance to a circle of loose stones about a yard and a half in
diameter, which had been specially constructed for the occasion. Just
before the buffalo sacrifice, a man of the Paiki clan standing near
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>the head of the corpse, dug a hole in the ground
with a cane, and asked a Kenna who was standing on the other side,
&ldquo;Puzhut, Kenna,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2758src" href=
"#xd21e2758" name="xd21e2758src">51</a> shall I throw the
earth?&mdash;three times. To which the Kenna, answering, replied
&ldquo;Puzhut&rdquo;&mdash;throw the earth&mdash;thrice. The Paiki then
threw some earth three times over the corpse, and three times into the
miniature kraal. It is suggested by Dr. Rivers that the circle was made
to do duty for a buffalo pen, as the funeral was held at a place where
there was no tu (pen), from the entrance of which earth could be dug
up.</p>
<p>Several examples of laments relating to the virtues and life of the
deceased, which are sung or recited in the course of the funeral
ceremonies, are given by Dr. Rivers. On the occasion of the
reproduction of a lament in my phonograph, two young women were seen to
be crying bitterly. The selection of the particular lament was
unfortunate, as it had been sung at their father&rsquo;s funeral. The
reproduction of the recitation of a dead person&rsquo;s sins at a
Badaga funeral quickly restored them to a state of cheerfulness.</p>
<p>The following petition to the Collector of the Nilgiris on the
subject of buffalo sacrifice may be quoted as a sign of the times, when
the Todas employ petition-writers to express their
grievances:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to our religious custom for the long period, we are
bringing forward of our killing buffaloes without any irregular way.
But, in last year, when the late Collector came to see the said place,
by that he ordered to the Todas first not to keep the buffaloes without
feeding in the kraal, and second he ordered to kill each for every day,
and to clear away the buffaloes, and not to keep the buffaloes without
food. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>We did our work according to his orders, and
this excellent order was an ample one. Now this &mdash;&mdash;, a chief
of the Todas, son of &mdash;&mdash;, a deceased Toda, the above man
joined with the moniagar of &mdash;&mdash; village, joined together,
and, dealing with bribes, now they arose against us, and doing this
great troubles on us, and also, by this great trouble, one day Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; came for shooting snapes (snipe) by that side. By chance
one grazing buffalo came to him, push him by his horns very forcely,
and wounded him on his leg. By the help of another gentleman who came
with him he escaped, or he would have die at the moment. Now the said
moniagar and &mdash;&mdash; joined together, want to finish the funeral
to his late father on the 18th instant. For this purpose they are going
to shut the buffaloes without food in the kraal on the 18th instant at
10 o&rsquo;clock. They are going to kill the buffaloes on the 19th
instant at 4 o&rsquo;clock in the evening. But this is a great sin
against god. But we beg your honour this way. That is, let them leave
the buffaloes in the grazing place, and ask them to catch and kill them
at the same moment. And also your honour cannot ordered them to keep
them in the kraal without food. And, if they will desire to kill the
buffaloes in this way, these buffaloes will come on us, and also on the
other peoples one who, coming to see funs on those day, will kill them
all by his anxious. And so we the Todas begs your honour to enquire
them before the 18th, the said funeral ceremony commencing, and not to
grant the above orders to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Whit Monday at Paik&#257;ra was given up to an exhibition of
sports and games, whereof the most exciting and interesting was a
burlesque representation of a Toda funeral by boys and girls. A Toda,
who was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>fond of his little joke, applied the term
pacchai k&#275;du (green funeral) to the corpses of the flies entrapped
by a viscous catch&rsquo;em-alive-oh on the bungalow table. To the mock
funeral rites arrived a party of youths, as from a distant mand, and
crying out U, hah, in shrill mimicry of their elders. The lad who was
to play the leading part of sacrificial buffalo, stripping off his
putk&#363;li, disappeared from sight over the brow of a low hillock.
Above this eminence his bent and uplifted upper extremities shortly
appeared as representatives of the buffalo horns. At sight thereof,
there was a wild rush of small boys to catch him, and a mimic struggle
took place, while the buffalo was dragged, amid good-tempered
scuffling, kicks, and shouting, to the spot where the corpse should
have been. This spot was, in the absence of a pseudo-dead body or stage
dummy, indicated by a group of little girls, who had sat chatting
together till the boy-beast arrived, when they touched foreheads, and
went, with due solemnity, through the orthodox observance of mourning
in couples. The buffalo was slain by a smart tap on the back of the
head with a cloth, which did duty for an axe. As soon as the convulsive
movements and twitchings of the death struggle were over, the buffalo,
without waiting for an encore, retired behind the hillock once more, in
order that the rough and tumble fight, which was evidently the chief
charm of the game, might be repeated. The buffalo boy later on came in
second in a flat race, and he was last seen protecting us from a
mischievous-looking member of his herd, which was grazing on the
main-road. Toda buffaloes, it may be noted, are not at all popular with
members of the Ootacamund Hunt, as both horses and riders from time to
time receive injuries from their horns, when they come in collision.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=

<p>While the funeral game was in progress, the men showed off their
prowess at a game (eln),<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2777src" href=
"#xd21e2777" name="xd21e2777src">52</a> corresponding to the English
tip-cat, which is epidemic at a certain season in the London
bye-streets. It is played with a bat like a broomstick, and a
cylindrical piece of wood pointed at both ends. The latter is propped
up against a stone, and struck with the bat. As it flies off the stone,
it is hit to a distance with the bat, and caught (or missed) by the out
fields.</p>
<p>At the Muttan&#257;d mand, we were treated to a further exhibition
of games. In one of these, called narthpimi, a flat slab of stone is
supported horizontally on two other slabs fixed perpendicularly in the
ground so as to form a narrow tunnel, through which a man can just
manage to wriggle his body with difficulty. Two men take part in the
game, one stationing himself at a distance of about thirty yards, the
other about sixty yards from the tunnel. The front man, throwing off
his mantle, runs as hard as he can to the tunnel, pursued by the
&lsquo;scratch&rsquo; man, whose object is to touch the other
man&rsquo;s feet before he has squeezed himself through the tunnel.
Another sport, which we witnessed, consists of trial of strength with a
heavy globular stone, the object being to raise it up to the shoulder;
but a strong, well-built-man&mdash;he who was entrusted with slaying
the funeral buffalo&mdash;failed to raise it higher than the pit of the
stomach, though straining his muscles in the attempt. A splendidly made
veteran assured me that, when young and lusty, he was able to
accomplish the feat, and spoke sadly of degeneration in the physique of
the younger members of the tribe.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeks mentions that the Todas play a game resembling
puss-in-the-corner, called k&#257;ri&#257;lapimi, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>was
not included in the programme of sports got up for our benefit. Dr.
Rivers writes that &ldquo;the Todas, and especially the children, often
play with mimic representations of objects from practical life. Near
the villages I have seen small artificial buffalo-pens and fireplaces
made by the children in sport.&rdquo; I have, on several occasions,
come across young children playing with long and short pieces of twigs
representing buffaloes and their calves, and going solemnly through the
various incidents in the daily life of these animals. Todas, both old
and young, may constantly be seen twisting flexible twigs into
representations of buffaloes&rsquo; heads and horns.</p>

<p class="first">The religious institutions of the Todas, including the
elaborate dairy ritual, and their religion, are described in full
detail by Dr. Rivers. The Todas have been to some extent influenced by
Hinduism, and some visit the temples at Nanjeng&#333;d in Mysore,
Karamadai in the Coimbatore district, and other shrines, whereat they
worship, present votive offerings, and pray for offspring, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>etc.
Writing in 1872, Mr. Breeks remarked that &ldquo;about Ootacamund, a
few Todas have latterly begun to imitate the religious practices of
their native neighbours. Occasionally children&rsquo;s foreheads are
marked with the Siva spot, and my particular friend Kinniaven, after an
absence of some days, returned with a shaven head from a visit to the
temple of Siva at Nanjengudi.&rdquo; A man who came to my laboratory
had his hair hanging down in long tails reaching below his shoulders.
He had, he said, let it grow long because his wife, though married five
years, had borne no child. A child had, however, recently been born,
and, as soon as the second funeral of a relation had been performed, he
was going to sacrifice his locks as a thank-offering at the
Nanjeng&#333;d temple. The following extracts from my notes will serve
to illustrate the practice of marking (in some instances apparently for
beauty&rsquo;s sake) and shaving as carried out at the present day.</p>
<p>(1) Man, aged 28. Has just performed a ceremony at the ti mand.
White curved line painted across forehead, and dots below outer ends
thereof, on glabella, and outside orbits. Smeared with white across
chest, over outer side of upper arms and left nipple, across knuckles
and lower end of left ulna, and on lobes of ears.</p>
<p>(2) Man, aged 21. Painted on forehead as above. Smeared over chest
and upper eye lids.</p>
<p>(3) Man, aged 35. White spot painted on forehead.</p>
<p>(4) Man, aged 30. Hair of head and beard cut short owing to death of
grandfather.</p>
<p>(5) Boy, aged 12. Shock head of hair, cut very short all over owing
to death of grandfather.</p>
<p>(6) Girl, aged 8. Hair shaved on top, back and sides of head, and in
median strip from vertex to forehead. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>(7) Boy, aged 6. White spot painted between eyebrows. Hair shaved on
top and sides of head, and in median strip from vertex to forehead.
Hair brought forward in fringe over forehead on either side of median
strip, and hanging down back of neck.</p>

<p><b>Todupuzha Vell&#257;la.</b>&mdash;For the following note, I am
indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. Besides the Nanchin&#257;d
Vell&#257;las, there are, in Travancore, two sections of the
Vell&#257;la caste, inhabiting the mountainous Todupuzha t&#257;luk.
These are the Tenkanchi and Kumbak&#333;nam Vell&#257;las. The former
are known by the popular name of Anjuttilkar, or the five hundred, and
the latter are designated Munnutilkar, or the three hundred, in
reference to the number of families which originally settled in the
taluk. Like the Nanchin&#257;d Vell&#257;las, they take the title of
Pillai, and, in special cases, the honorific prefix Kanakku.</p>
<p>The Tenkanchi Vell&#257;las appear to have dwelt originally in the
Tenk&#257;si taluk of the Tinnevelly district, and to have emigrated,
as the legend goes, on account of the demand of a Vaduka ruler for the
hand of a member of their community in marriage. The Vadakkumkur
R&#257;jas were ruling over Todupuzha at the time of their migration,
and afforded them a safe asylum. The Kumbak&#333;nam Vell&#257;las
believe that they emigrated to Travancore about the commencement of the
Malabar era from Kumbak&#333;nam in the Tanjore district. Both
divisions speak Malay&#257;lam, but there are clear indications in
their speech that their mother-tongue was once Tamil, and they always
use that language in their ceremonial writings. The Anjuttilkar women
have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>adopted the dress and ornaments of the
N&#257;yars. Both sections wear the tuft of hair in front, but the
Munnutilkar women do not tie the hair on the left side like the
N&#257;yars and Anjuttilkars, but behind like the P&#257;ndi
Vell&#257;las. Nor do the Anjuttilkar women wear a white dress like the
Tenkanchis, but a coloured cloth, sixteen cubits in length, in orthodox
Tamil fashion. Again, while the Tenkanchi women largely resort to the
todu and other N&#257;yar ornaments, the Kumbak&#333;nam women are more
conservative, and wear only the pampadam and melidu, though they
sometimes wear jewels, such as the n&#257;gapata t&#257;li for the
neck. Both sections are Saivites, in the sense that they abstain from
flesh and fish.</p>
<p>Their principal occupation is agriculture. They worship the two
mountain deities Bhadrak&#257;li and Durg&#257;. In the Kirikkot muri
of the Karikkod <span class="corr" id="xd21e3025" title=
"Source: proverty">property</span> there is a temple dedicated to Siva
or Unnamalanathar, with a large amount of property attached to it. This
belongs to the Tenkanchi Vell&#257;las, and a Malay&#257;lam
Br&#257;hman performs the priestly functions. The Kumbak&#333;nam
Vell&#257;las have their own temples, such as the Ankalamma koil,
Annamala matam, V&#299;rabhadran koil, etc., and worship, besides the
principal gods of the Hindu pantheon, such minor deities as
V&#299;rabhadran, Karuppan, Bhairavan, M&#257;riamman, and Muttaramman.
The priests of both sections are East Coast Br&#257;hmans, who live in
the Todupuzha t&#257;luk. As their profession is regarded by other
Br&#257;hmans as degrading, they, especially in the case of the
Kumbak&#333;nam Vell&#257;las, perform their duties stealthily. The
headman of the Kumbak&#333;nam section lives in the Periyakulam
t&#257;luk of the Madura district, and, by his order, an image of Siva
is worshipped at their homes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169"
href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>Divorce is not permitted on any ground, and, in ancient days, widow
remarriage was forbidden. There is a legend that a woman of this caste,
who was a friend of the daughter of a certain Vadakkumkur R&#257;jah,
was so aggrieved at the news of her newly married husband&rsquo;s death
that, at her intercession, the R&#257;jah issued a proclamation
permitting the remarriage of widows. If no husband has been found for a
girl before she reaches puberty, certain propitiatory rites have to be
performed, at which one of her female relations represents her. On the
fourth day of the marriage ceremony, the bride and bridegroom, before
they bathe, rub each other&rsquo;s bodies with oil, and, going to a
large caldron containing water, throw a gold and silver ring into it,
and pick them out three times. Inheritance of both sections is from
father to son (makkath&#257;yam). A sambandham alliance does not confer
any rite of inheritance.</p>
<p>The names of both sections are such as are unknown among
N&#257;yars, <i>e.g.</i>, Sivalingam, Arun&#257;chalam, Chidambaram,
Arumukham. The Tenkanchis are considered to be higher in the social
scale than the Kumbak&#333;nam section, as they observe only twelve
days&rsquo; death pollution, whereas the latter are under pollution for
sixteen days. The Tenkanchis may enter the temple, and, like
N&#257;yars, stand on the left side of the inner shrine, whereas the
Kumbak&#333;nam Vell&#257;las may proceed only as far as the
balikkalpura, or out-house of the temple, and not enter the nalambalam.
Again, butter-milk is freely received by Br&#257;hmans from the
Tenkanchis, but not from members of the Kumbak&#333;nam section. While
P&#257;ndi Vell&#257;las will not receive food from the Tenkanchis, or
give their daughters in marriage to them, the latter will not
intermarry with the N&#257;nchin&#257;d Vell&#257;las. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>Togata.</b>&mdash;The Togatas are Telugu weavers, most numerous
in the Cuddapah district, who manufacture the coarsest kind of cotton
cloths, such as are worn by the poorer classes. They are generally
Vaishnavites, wear the sacred thread, and have for their priests
Vaishnava Br&#257;hmans or S&#257;t&#257;nis. They eat flesh, and their
widows are allowed to remarry. Writing concerning the Togatas in 1807,
Buchanan states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3042src" href="#xd21e3042"
name="xd21e3042src">53</a> that &ldquo;widows cannot marry again, but
are not expected to kill themselves. The Panchanga, or village
astrologer, attends at births, marriages, funerals, at the ceremonies
performed in honour of their deceased parents, and at the building of a
new house, and on each occasion gets a fee of one fanam, or eight
pence. On other occasions, when a weaver wants to pray, he calls in a
Satanana, who reads something in an unknown language, and gives the
votary some holy water, which he consecrates by pouring it on the head
of a small image that he carries about for the purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As regards their origin, some Togatas claim to be sons of
Chaud&#275;svari, who threw some rice on to the fire, from which sprang
a host of warriors, whose descendants they are. Others give
P&#363;ppandaja Rishi as the name of their ancestor. Concerning
Chaud&#275;svari, Mr. Francis writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3047src" href="#xd21e3047" name="xd21e3047src">54</a>
&ldquo;Connected with the margosa tree (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia
Azadirachta</i>) is the worship of Chaud&#275;svari, the goddess of the
Togata caste of weavers. She is supposed to reside in margosa trees,
and either the tree itself, or a stone representing the goddess and
placed at its foot, is worshipped by the Togatas at certain seasons,
such as the Telugu New Year Day. Apparently the other weaver castes
take no share in the ceremonies. They consist largely of animal
sacrifices. Nevertheless, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>particular class of Br&#257;hmans,
called Nandavar&#299;kula Br&#257;hmans, take a prominent part in the
festival. This name Nandavar&#299;kula is derived from the village of
Nandavaram in Kurnool, and doubtless many stories are prevalent there
about this sub-division. The account given at Tadpatri, where they are
fairly numerous, is as follows. Once upon a time, a king from Southern
India went on a pilgrimage with his wife to Benares. While there, he
unwittingly incurred a nameless but heinous pollution. Horrified, he
applied to some Br&#257;hmans there to purify him, promising them half
his kingdom in return. They asked for some tangible record of this
promise, and the king called upon the goddess Chaud&#275;svari, who had
a temple near by, to witness his oath. The purification was effected,
and he departed home. Later on the Br&#257;hmans came south, and asked
for the fulfilment of his promise. The king declared that he could not
remember having made any such undertaking. The Br&#257;hmans
accordingly went to Benares, and asked Chaud&#275;svari to come south,
and bear witness to the king&rsquo;s oaths. She agreed, on the usual
condition that they should go in front, and not look back at her as she
came. As happens in other stories of the same kind, they are said to
have broken the condition. At Nandavaram they looked back, and the
goddess instantly stopped, and remained immoveable. A temple was built
for her there, and the Br&#257;hmans remained in the south, and still
take part in the worship of Chaud&#275;svari which the Togatas
inaugurate, even though she is not one of the Hindu pantheon, and
delights in animal sacrifice. At Tadpatri other castes besides the
Togatas help at the festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Chaud&#275;svari is the patron god of the Togatas, they also
worship Poleramma, Ellamma, Kotamma, and other minor deities.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span></p>
<p>The original occupation of the Togatas is said to have been dyeing,
but, at the present day, owing to the depression in the hand-loom
weaving industry, a large number have taken to cultivation.</p>
<p>Like many other Telugu castes, they have exogamous septs, of which
the following are examples:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>P&#257;tha, old.</li>
<li>Kambhapu, pillar.</li>
<li>N&#299;li, indigo.</li>
<li>Madaka, plough.</li>
<li>Bana, pot.</li>
<li>J&#299;lakara, cummin seed.</li>
<li>Annam, food.</li>

<li>Perum&#257;l, a god.</li>
<li>Band&#257;ri, treasurer?</li>
<li>Gudditi.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>P&#363;j&#257;ris (priests) for temple worship are always elected
from the Perum&#257;l sept, and caste messengers from the Band&#257;ri
sept, if they are represented in a settlement. Torches are generally
carried, at processions, by men of the Gudditi sept. Members of the
Gurram sept are not allowed to ride on horseback.</p>
<p>The panch&#257;yat (village council) system is in vogue, but, in
some places, a headman is selected, as occasion requires. In their
marriage and funeral ceremonies, the Togatas closely follow the Telugu
standard Pur&#257;nic form of ceremonial. The dead are buried in a
recumbent posture. On the last day of the death rites, the
S&#257;t&#257;ni gives arrack (liquor) to the Togatas, as to the Padma
S&#257;l&#275;s, in lieu of holy water (thirtham).</p>

<p><b>T&#333;lkollan.</b>&mdash;The T&#333;lkollans or T&#333;lans
(skin people) are summed up in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as
&ldquo;leather workers and dyers, and also gymnasts and teachers of
gymnastics. They are also called Vatti Kurup, Ch&#257;ya Kurup, and Vil
Kurup. Their title is Kurup.&rdquo; The T&#333;lkollans are
stated<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3119src" href="#xd21e3119" name=
"xd21e3119src">55</a> to be &ldquo;blacksmiths by caste, who abandoned
their hereditary trade for leather work, and they are chiefly employed
by M&#257;ppillas. One peculiar custom in this caste is that two or
more brothers may have one wife in common. Only those in good
circumstances indulge in the luxury of a private wife. The following
information furnished by Mr. S. Vaidyanadha Aiyar, the headmaster of
the School of Commerce, Calicut, gives some information regarding
leather work in Malabar:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Boots and shoes of country make and English pattern.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Harness making.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Native shoes (ceruppu). These are of the special pattern
peculiar to Malabar, and are largely used by all classes of the Hindu
and M&#257;ppilla communities. The Arabs who visit this coast once a
year purchase a considerable number to take back with them. The price
of a pair varies from Rs. 1&ndash;8&ndash;0 to Rs. 5. Those with
ornamental gold lace work cost from Rs. 10 to Rs. 50. These shoes are
generally used by well-to-do M&#257;ppillas. White of egg is used to
give a creaking sound to the shoes. This work is mainly done by
Th&#333;lperunkollans <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>and M&#257;ppillas, and the latter
show more skill in finish and ornamental work.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Knife sheaths. Almost every N&#257;yar, Tiyan and
M&#257;ppilla carries a knife about a foot in length, and there is a
demand for leather sheaths. These are made by P&#257;nans as well as by
Th&#333;lperunkollans and M&#257;ppillas.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Leather baskets are also made, and are largely used as
receptacles for carrying pepper, paddy (rice), and other grain.</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Winnowing fans are made of leather, and are used in
pepper and paddy yards, etc.</p>

husked rice in Madras, used the Sh&#257;n&#257;n title N&#257;d&#257;n.

<p><b>Tondam&#257;n.</b>&mdash;It is stated, in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, that the Tondam&#257;ns are &ldquo;also called
Sunn&#257;mbukk&#257;ran (<i>q.v.</i>), a Tamil caste of lime (chunam)
burners found only in the Tinnevelly district. They are said to be a
branch of the Kallans who migrated to Tinnevelly from Pudukk&#333;ttai,
or the Tondam&#257;n&rsquo;s country. Its members are now drummers and
pipers as well as lime-burners. Br&#257;hmans are their pur&#333;hits,
but they are not allowed to go into Hindu temples. They will eat in the
houses of Maravans. Their title is S&#333;lagan.&rdquo; It is noted, in
the same report, that the Semm&#257;n caste &ldquo;has two
sub-divisions, <span class="corr" id="xd21e3175" title=

the family name of the R&#257;ja of Pudukk&#333;ttai, a Native State
surrounded by the British districts of Tanjore, Madura, and
Trichinopoly. The R&#257;ja is the head of the Kallan caste. Copper
coins, called amman k&#257;su, are current only within the State, and
their greatest distribution is during Navar&#257;tri or Dusserah, when
they are issued to the people with a dole of rice every day during the
nine days of the festival. They bear on one side the word
&ldquo;Vijaya,&rdquo; meaning victory, or more probably having
reference to our faithful ally Vijaya Ragun&#257;tha Tondam&#257;n, in
whose reign they were first struck, it is said in 1761, after the
surrender of Pondicherry to the British.</p>
<p><b>Tondamandalam.</b>&mdash;The name of a sub-division of
Vell&#257;la, derived from Tondan&#257;du, the ancient Pallava
country.</p>
<p><b>Tonti.</b>&mdash;The Tontis are said to be cotton-weavers of
Bengal, who have settled in Ganjam.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3188src"
href="#xd21e3188" name="xd21e3188src">56</a> The name denotes
threadmen, and the weaving of rough white cloths is the traditional
occupation of the caste. All Tontis belong to a single g&#333;tra named
after K&#257;syapa, one of the seven important rishis, and the priest
of Parasur&#257;ma. Various bamsams or exogamous septs, the names of
some of which occur also as titles, exist, <i>e.g.</i>, Bisw&#257;lo,
Dasso, P&#257;lo, Bono, Chondo, Parimaniko, Korono, B&#275;hara, and
Mah&#257;p&#257;tro. The marriage and death ceremonies conform to the
standard Oriya type. On the fourth day of the marriage rites, a
Bhond&#257;ri (barber) is presented with some beaten rice and
sugar-candy in a new earthen pot. These are sold to those who have
assembled, and the proceeds go to the Bhond&#257;ri. <span class=

corpse of a dead person is washed at the burning ground, instead of, in

<p><b>Toppa T&#257;li.</b>&mdash;A name applied to certain
V&#257;niyans in the North Arcot district, owing to the peculiar
t&#257;li (marriage badge) which married women wear.</p>
<p><b>Torai.</b>&mdash;A title of various Oriya castes.</p>
<p><b>Toreya.</b>&mdash;The Toreyas are a Canarese class, living
chiefly in the Tamil districts of Coimbatore and Salem. They are said
to have been originally fishermen and palanquin bearers, and the name
is derived from turai, a river gh&#257;t. Most of them are now
cultivators, especially of the betel vine (<i lang="la-x-bio">Piper
betle</i>). Those whom I examined at Coimbatore were earning their
living as betel and sugar-cane cultivators, vendors of tobacco, bakers,
cloth merchants, contractors, petty traders, and police constables.</p>
<p>By the Coimbatore Toreyas, the following endogamous divisions were
returned:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Elai, leaf. Betel cultivators.</li>
<li>Chunam, lime. Lime burners.</li>
<li>G&#257;zul, glass bangle. The Toreya caste is said to have
originated from the bangles of Machyagandhi or Gandhavati, the daughter
of a fisherman on the Jumna. She was married to king Shantanu of
Hastinap&#363;r, who was one of the ancestors of the heroes of the
Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many exogamous septs exist among the Toreyas, of which the following
are examples:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Belli, silver. May not wear silver toe-rings.</li>
<li>N&#257;ga, snake. The members of the sept, at times of marriage,
worship ant-hills, which are the home of snakes.</li>
<li>Alwar or Garuda. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177"
name="pb177">177</a>]</span></li>
<li>Chinnam, gold.</li>
<li>Kansugaje, small bronze bells, tied to the legs when dancing.</li>
<li>Urukathi, a kind of knife.</li>
<li>Vajjira, diamond.</li>
<li>Vasishta, a Hindu saint.</li>
<li>Mogila, clouds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Onne (<i lang="la-x-bio">Pterocarpus Marsupium</i>). Do not mark
their foreheads with the juice from the trunk of this tree.</p>
<p>Kuzhal, the flute played by shepherd boys and snake charmers. If the
sound thereof is heard during a meal, what remains of the food should
be thrown away.</p>
<p>R&#257;kshasa, a giant. Do not celebrate the D&#299;p&#257;vali
festival in honour of the victory over, and death of, a
r&#257;kshasa.</p>
<p>Erumai, buffalo.</p>
<p>The headman of the caste is called Ejaman, who has under him an
officer entitled Dalavayi. The caste messenger bears the name of
Kondikar. These three offices are hereditary. The Ejaman presides at
council meetings which are held at the temple of the caste. The eldest
member of each family is entitled to a seat on the council. Those who
come late to a meeting thereof prostrate themselves before the
assembly. Witnesses before the council have to take an oath, which is
administered by the Kondikar. He makes the witness stand within a
circle drawn on the ground, and makes him repeat the formula
&ldquo;Before God and the elders assembled, with the sky above and the
earth beneath, I will state only the truth.&rdquo; The Kondikar then
takes up a pinch of earth, and puts it on the head of the witness. For
merely threatening to beat a person with shoes, the offender has to
feed twenty-five castemen. If he takes the shoes in his hands he must
feed fifty, and, if he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href=
"#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>actually resorts to beating with
them, he has to feed a hundred men. In addition, the culprit has to pay
a small fine, and both parties have to be purified at the temple. A
similar punishment is enforced for beating, or threatening to beat with
a broom. For adultery the guilty person is excommunicated, and is
admitted back into the caste only after the death of one of the parties
concerned. He then has to feed a large number of castemen, or pay a
money fine, and, prostrating himself before the assembly, he is beaten
with a tamarind switch. He further makes obeisance to the Ejaman, and
washes his feet. The Ejaman then purifies him by a small piece of
burning camphor in his mouth.</p>
<p>When a married girl reaches puberty, she is taken to her
father&rsquo;s house, and her husband constructs a hut with branches of
<i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus glomerata</i>. On the last day of her
confinement therein, the hut is pulled down, and the girl sets fire to
it. The house is purified, and the female relations go to the houses of
the Ejaman and caste people, and invite them to be present at a
ceremonial. A small quantity of turmeric paste is stuck on the doors of
the houses of all who are invited. The relations and members of the
caste carry betel, and other articles, on trays in procession through
the streets. The girl is seated on a plank, and the trays are placed in
front of her. Rice flour, fruits, betel, etc., are tied in her cloth,
and she is taken into the house. In the case of an unmarried girl, the
hut is built by her maternal uncle.</p>
<p>Marriage is always celebrated at the house of the bridegroom, as
there is a legend that a R&#257;jah belonging to the Toreya caste had a
son, who was taken to the house of his bride elect, and there murdered.
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>bridegroom&rsquo;s father and relations go to
the house of the bride, and make presents of money, cloths, ornaments,
etc. They also have to make obeisance to, and feed five married women
sumptuously. Pandals (booths) are constructed at the houses of both the
bride and bridegroom. Five married women go, on behalf of each of the
contracting parties, to their houses, and pound rice there. On the
second day, five such women fetch water from a tank, and bathe the
bride and bridegroom respectively. The ten women then go to the
potter&rsquo;s house, and bring five decorated pots. Three of these are
taken to a tank, and filled with water. On the following day, the
bridegroom and his sister take the two remaining pots to the tank, and
fill them with water. The five pots are placed in the pandal, and
represent the household gods. The relations of the bridegroom take
twelve kinds of ornaments, a new cloth, flowers, etc., to the house of
the Ejaman, and go with him to the bride&rsquo;s house. She is then
bathed, and decked with finery. A Br&#257;hman does p&#363;ja (worship)
and ties on her forehead a mandaikettu or bashingham (chaplet) made of
gold leaf or tinsel. She is then carried in procession to the house of
the bridegroom. Meanwhile, the Br&#257;hman ties a mandaikettu on the
forehead of the bridegroom, who puts on the sacred thread, and sits
within the pandal, holding a katar (dagger) in his hand, and closed in
by a screen. The bride goes thrice round this screen, and the
Br&#257;hman does p&#363;ja and gives advice (upad&#275;sam) to the
couple. The screen is then lowered slightly, and the bride and
bridegroom garland each other. The bride&rsquo;s parents place a few
gingelly (<i lang="la-x-bio">Sesamum</i>) seeds in the hand of the
bridegroom, and pour water thereon, saying that their daughter belongs
to him, and telling him to take care of her. The t&#257;li, after being
blessed by those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180"
name="pb180">180</a>]</span>assembled, is given by the Br&#257;hman to
the bridegroom, who ties it on the bride&rsquo;s neck. The screen is
then removed, and the couple sit side by side. The sacred fire is
lighted, their hands are linked together, and the ends of their cloths
tied together. They then leave the pandal, and, placing their feet on a
grindstone, look at the pole-star (Arundati). Entering the pandal once
more, they sit therein, and the elders bless them by throwing rice
coloured with turmeric over their heads. On the fourth day, they again
sit within the pandal, and cooked rice, coloured white, red, yellow,
green, and black, on five trays, and nine lighted wicks on a tray are
waved before them. Five married men and women, holding a string, stand
round them in a circle, within which is the bride&rsquo;s brother with
a twig of p&#299;pal (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus religiosa</i>). The
bridegroom places his hands together, and small rice cakes are placed
on the head, shoulders, bend of the elbows and knees, and between the
fingers of the couple. They are then bathed, and, taking betel in their
hands, bow to the four corners of the earth. The bridegroom makes a
n&#257;mam (Vaishnavite sect mark), or places vibh&#363;ti (sacred
ashes) on the twelve posts of the pandal, and the bride places a little
cooked rice and water before each post, to which camphor is burnt, and
p&#363;ja done. They then start for the bride&rsquo;s house, but the
bride&rsquo;s sister meets them at the entrance thereto, and will not
allow them to go in until she has extracted a promise that their child
shall marry hers. The bride proceeds to a tank, sowing some paddy
(rice) on the way thither, and brings back a pot of water, with which
she washes her husband&rsquo;s hands and feet. Husband and wife then
feed each other with a small quantity of rice and milk. Their hands are
then cleaned, and the bride&rsquo;s brother puts a gold ring on the
finger of the bridegroom. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href=
"#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>A tray with betel leaves and areca
nuts is brought, and the bridegroom ties three handfuls thereof in his
cloth. The newly married couple then worship at the temple. On the
fifth day, they carry the earthen pots to a river, and, on their
return, five married women are worshipped and fed. Five men have to
come forward as sureties for the good behaviour of the couple, and
declare before those assembled that they will hold themselves
responsible for it. In the evening the pair go to the bride&rsquo;s
house, and rub oil over each other&rsquo;s head before bathing in
turmeric water. On the following day they repair to the house of the
bridegroom.</p>
<p>The corpse of a dead Toreya is placed in a pandal constructed of
cocoanut leaves and stems of the milk-hedge (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Euphorbia Tirucalli</i>). Sect marks are placed on the
foreheads of the corpse and the widow. The son of the deceased dons the
sacred thread. The funeral ceremonies resemble, in many particulars,
those of the Odd&#275;s. A mound is piled up over the grave. A Paraiyan
places a small twig of the arka plant (<i lang="la-x-bio">Calotropis
gigantea</i>) in three corners of the grave, leaving out the north-east
corner, and the son puts a small coin on each twig. As he goes round
the grave with a water-pot and fire-brand, his maternal uncle, who
stands at the head of the grave, makes holes in the pot. On the third,
fifth, seventh, or ninth day, the widow, dressed in new cloths, and
bedecked with ornaments and flowers, is taken to the burial-ground,
with offerings of milk, gh&#299; (clarified butter), tender cocoanut,
sandal, camphor, etc. Five small stones, smeared with turmeric and
lime, are set up at the head of the grave, and worshipped. The widow
goes thrice round the grave, and seats herself near the head thereof.
Her brother holds up her arms, and one of her husband&rsquo;s male
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>relations breaks her bangles. She breaks, and
throws her t&#257;li on the grave, with the flowers which adorn her.
Her ornaments are removed, and she is covered with a cloth, and taken
to a river, where she is rubbed with cow-dung and bathed. The son and
other relatives go to the temple with butter and other articles. A
Br&#257;hman does p&#363;ja, and shuts the doors of the temple. The
son, with his back to the temple, throws a little butter on the doors,
which are then opened by the Br&#257;hman. This is done thrice. On the
seventh day, pollution is removed by sprinkling holy water, and the
caste people are fed. A widow remains in seclusion (g&#333;sha) for
three months. Sr&#257;dh (memorial ceremony) is performed.</p>
<p>The Toreyas worship both Siva and Vishnu, but consider Ayodhya
R&#257;man as their special deity, and sacrifice sheep and fowls to
Koriamma.</p>
<p><b>Toreya.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of the Badagas of the
N&#299;lgiris.</p>
<p><b>T&#333;ta</b> (garden).&mdash;Recorded as a sub-division of
cultivating Balijas, and an exogamous sept of B&#333;ya, Chenchu,
V&#257;da Balija (or Mila), Mutr&#257;cha and Bonthuk Savara. The
equivalent T&#333;ta occurs as an exogamous sept of K&#257;pu and
Y&#257;n&#257;di. T&#333;ta D&#275;varu, or garden god, is the name of

<p><b>T&#333;ti.</b>&mdash;The T&#333;ti or Totti is one of the village
communal servants. The name has been derived from tondu, to dig, or
tott, to go round, as the T&#333;ti is the purveyor of news, and has to
summon people to appear before the village council. The functions of
this useful person to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href=
"#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>the community have been summed up
as follows by a district official.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3318src"
href="#xd21e3318" name="xd21e3318src">57</a> &ldquo;This individual has
all the dirty work of the village allotted to him. He is of the lowest
caste, and hence makes no scruple of doing any manner of work that he
may be called upon to perform. The removal and sepulture of unclaimed
dead bodies, the cleansing of choultries, rest-houses and the like,
where travellers carrying infectious diseases might have halted, and
other gruesome duties are entrusted to him. In spite of all this, the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3321" title="Source: Toti">T&#333;ti</span>
is one of the most trusted of the humbler servants of the village
community. Considering his humble status and emoluments, which average
between Rs. 3 and Rs. 4 a month, his honesty with regard to pecuniary
matters is wonderful. He may be trusted with untold wealth, as is often
done when he is the sole custodian of the revenue collections of his
village to the tune of several thousands at a time, when on their way
from the collecting officers to the Government Treasury.&rdquo;
Testimony is borne to the industry of the T&#333;ti in the proverb that
if you work like a T&#333;ti, you can enjoy the comforts of a king.</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1891, T&#333;ti is returned as a
sub-division of Chakkiliyan. The T&#333;ti of Mysore is defined by Mr.
L. Rice<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3327src" href="#xd21e3327" name=
"xd21e3327src">58</a> as a menial among the village servants, a deputy
tal&#257;ri, who is employed to watch the crops from the growing crop
to the granary.</p>
<p>Odiya T&#333;ti is a Tamil synonym for Oriya Haddis employed as
scavengers in municipalities in the Tamil country.</p>
<p><b>Tottiyan.</b>&mdash;In the Census Report, 1901, Mr. W. Francis
writes that the Tottiyans are &ldquo;Telugu <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>cultivators. The Tottiyans or Kambalatt&#257;ns
of the Tanjore district are, however, said to be vagrants, and to live
by pig-breeding, snake-charming, and begging. So are the sub-division
called K&#257;ttu Tottiyans in Tinnevelly. The headman among the
Tinnevelly Tottiyans is called the Mandai Periadanakk&#257;ran or
S&#275;rvaik&#257;ran. Their marriages are not celebrated in their
houses, but in pandals (booths) of green leaves erected for the purpose
on the village common. However wealthy the couple may be, the only
grain which they may eat at the wedding festivities is either cumbu
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Pennisetum typhoideum</i>) or horse-gram (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Dolichos biflorus</i>). The patron deities of the caste are
Jakkamma and Bommakka, two women who committed sati. The morality of
their women is loose. The custom of marrying boys to their paternal
aunt&rsquo;s or maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, however old she may
be, also obtains, and in such cases the bridegroom&rsquo;s father is
said to take upon himself the duty of begetting children to his own
son. Divorce is easy, and remarriage is freely allowed. They offer rice
and arrack (alcoholic liquor) to their ancestors. The K&#257;ttu
Tottiyans will eat jackals, rats, and the leavings of other people.
Tottiya women will not eat in the houses of Br&#257;hmans, but no
explanation of this is forthcoming. The men wear silver anklets on both
legs, and also a bracelet upon one of the upper arms, both of which
practices are uncommon, while the women wear bangles only on the left
arm, instead of on both as usual. Some of the Zamindars in Madura
belong to this caste. The caste title is N&#257;yakkan.&rdquo; At the
census, 1901, Kudulukk&#257;ran was returned as a sub-caste of the
Tottiyans in Madura and Tinnevelly. The Urumikk&#257;ran, meaning those
who play on the drum called urumi, are said to be Tottiyans in Madura
and Paraiyans elsewhere. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tottiyans or Kambalatt&#257;ns,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3347src" href="#xd21e3347" name=
"xd21e3347src">59</a> &ldquo;are a caste of Telugu cultivators settled
in the districts of Madura, Tinnevelly, Coimbatore and Salem. They are
probably the descendants of poligars and soldiers of the N&#257;yakkan
kings of Vijayanagar, who conquered the Madura country about the
beginning of the sixteenth century. As regards the origin of their
caste, the Tottiyans say with pride that they are the descendants of
the eight thousand g&#333;pastris (milkmaids) of Krishna&mdash;a
tradition which seems to indicate that their original occupation was
connected with the rearing and keeping of cattle. The most important
sub-divisions are Kollar and Erkollar, the Tamil form of the Telugu
Golla and Yerragolla, which are now shepherd castes, though probably
they formerly had as much to do with cattle as sheep. Another large
sub-division is Kille or Killavar, which I take to be a corruption of
the Telugu kil&#257;ri, a herdman. The bride and bridegroom, too, are
always seated on bullock saddles. They do not wear the sacred thread.
Most of them are Vaishnavites, some of whom employ Br&#257;hman
priests, but the majority of them are guided by gurus of their own,
called Kod&#257;ngi N&#257;yakkan. [It is noted, in the Gazetteer of
the Madura district, that caste matters used to be settled by the
M&#275;ttu N&#257;yakkan or headman, and a Kod&#257;ngi N&#257;yakkan,
or priest, so called because he carried a drum.] Each family has its
own household deity, which appears to be a sort of representation of
departed relations, chiefly women who have burned themselves on the
funeral pile of their husbands, or have led a chaste and continent
life, or died vestals. Their girls are married after they have attained
maturity. Adultery is no crime when committed within <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>the
family circle, but a <i>liaison</i> with an outsider involves expulsion
from the caste. It is said that their newly married girls are even
compelled to cohabit with their husband&rsquo;s near relatives. [It is
further said to be believed that ill-luck will attend any refusal to do
so, and that, so far from any disgrace attaching to them in
consequence, their priests compel them to keep up the custom, if by any
chance they are unwilling.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3355src" href=
"#xd21e3355" name="xd21e3355src">60</a>] The pongu tree (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Pongamia glabra</i>) is the sacred tree of the caste. Suttee
was formerly very common, and the remarriage of widows is discouraged,
if not actually forbidden. The dead are generally burned. Both men and
women are supposed to practice magic, and are on that account much
dreaded by the people generally. They are especially noted for their
power of curing snake-bites by means of mystical incantations, and the
original inventor of this mode of treatment has been deified under the
name P&#257;mbalamman. They are allowed to eat flesh. The majority
speak Telugu in their houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The traditional story of the migration of the Tottiyans to the
Madura district is given in several of the Mackenzie manuscripts, and
is still repeated by the people of the caste. &ldquo;Centuries ago,
says this legend, the Tottiyans lived to the north of the Tungabhadra
river. The Muhammadans there tried to marry their women, and make them
eat beef. So one fine night they fled southwards in a body. The
Muhammadans pursued them, and their path was blocked by a deep and
rapid river. They had just given themselves up for lost when a pongu
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Pongamia glabra</i>) tree on either side of the
stream leant forward, and, meeting in the middle, made <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>a
bridge across it. Over this they hurried, and, as soon as they had
passed, the trees stood erect once more, before the Mussulmans could
similarly cross by them. The Tottiyans in consequence still reverence
the pongu tree, and their marriage pandals (booths) are always made
from its wood. They travelled on until they came to the city of
Vijayanagar, under whose king they took service, and it was in the
train of the Vijayanagar armies that they came to
Madura.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3368src" href="#xd21e3368"
name="xd21e3368src">61</a></p>
<p>The Tottiyans are most numerous in the Madura and Tinnevelly
districts, and include two grades in the social scale. Of these, one
consists of those who are engaged in cultivation, and petty Zamindars.
The other is made up of those who wander about begging, and doing
menial work. Between the two classes there is neither interdining nor
intermarriage. In districts other than Madura and Tinnevelly, the name
Tottiyan is applied by Tamil-speaking castes to the J&#333;gis, who are
beggars and pig breeders, and, like the Tottiyans, speak Telugu. The
following legend is current, to account for the division of the
Tottiyans into two sections. They once gave a girl in marriage to a
Muhammadan ruler, and all the Tottiyans followed him. A large number
went to sleep on one side of a river, while the rest crossed, and went
away. The latter are represented today by the respectable section, and
the begging class is descended from the former. To this day the
Muhammadans and Tottiyans of the Trichinopoly district are said to
address each other as if they were relations, and to be on terms of
unusual intimacy.</p>
<p>In the Madura district, the Tottiyans are apparently divided into
three endogamous sections, viz., V&#275;kkili, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>Thokala, and Yerrakolla, of which the last is
considered inferior to the other two. Other names for the V&#275;kkili
section are Kambalattar, or R&#257;ja Kambalattar. In some places,
<i>e.g.</i>, in Tinnevelly, there seem to be six divisions, Thokala,
Chilla or Silla, Kolla, Narasilla, K&#257;nthikolla and P&#257;la. Of
these, P&#257;la may intermarry with Chilla, but the other four are
endogamous. As examples of exogamous septs occurring among the
Yerrakollas may be noted Ch&#299;kala (broom), and Udama (lizard,
<i lang="la-x-bio">Varanus</i>), of which the latter also occurs as an
exogamous sept of the K&#257;pus.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of Nellakota in the Madura district, the
Yerrakollas have a group of seven septs called R&#275;vala,
Gollav&#299;rappa, Kambli-nayudi, Karadi (bear), Uduma, Ch&#299;la, and
Gelipithi. Intermarriage between these is forbidden, as they are all
considered as blood-relations, and they must marry into a group of
seven other septs called Gundagala, B&#363;sala, Manni, Sukka,
Aliv&#299;rappa, Sikka, and M&#257;dha. The names of these septs are
remembered by a system of mnemonics.</p>
<p>In a note on the Tottiyans of the Trichinopoly district, Mr. F. R.
Hemingway writes as follows. &ldquo;Three endogamous sub-divisions
exist in the caste, namely, the Erra (red) Gollas or Pedda Inti (big
family), the Nalla (black) Gollas or Chinna Inti (small family), and
the V&#257;lus, who are also called Kudukuduppai Tottiyans. The
V&#257;lus are said to be a restless class of beggars and sorcerers.
The red Gollas are, as a rule, fairer than the blacks (whence perhaps
the names). The women of the former wear white cloths, while those of
the latter do not. Again, they tie their hair in different ways, and
their ornaments differ a good deal. The red women carry no emblem of
marriage at all, while the black women wear the pottu. The reds allow
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>widows to remarry, but the blacks do not. Both
sections have exogamous sections, called Kambalams&mdash;the reds
fourteen, and the blacks nine. The reds are divided, for purposes of
caste discipline, into nine n&#257;dus and the blacks into fourteen
mandais. Each village is under a headman called the
&#362;r-N&#257;yakan, and each n&#257;du or mandai under a
Pattak&#257;ran. The former decide petty disputes, and the latter the
more serious cases. The Pattak&#257;ran is treated with great
deference. He is always saluted with clasped hands, ought never to look
on a corpse, and is said to be allowed to consort with any married
woman of the caste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tottiyans are supposed to be one of the nine Kambalam (blanket)
castes, which, according to one version, are made up of
K&#257;ppiliyans, Anappans, Tottiyans, Kurubas, Kummaras,
Pariv&#257;rams, Urumikk&#257;rans, Mangalas, and Chakkiliyans.
According to another version, the nine castes are K&#257;ppiliyan,
Anappan, Tottiyan, Kolla Tottiyan, Kuruba, Kummara, M&#275;dara,
Odd&#275;, and Chakkiliyan. At tribal council-meetings, representatives
of each of the nine Kambalams should be present. But, for the nine
castes, some have substituted nine septs. The Vekkiliyans seem to have
three headmen, called Mettu N&#257;yakan, Kodia N&#257;yakan, and
Kambli N&#257;yakan, of whom the first mentioned is the most important,
and acts as priest on various ceremonial occasions, such as puberty and
marriage rites, and the worship of Jakkamma and Bommakka. The Kambli
N&#257;yakan attends to the purification of peccant or erring members
of the community, in connection with which the head of a sheep or goat
is taken into the house by the Kambli N&#257;yakan. It is noted, in the
Gazetteer of the Madura district, that &ldquo;persons charged with
offences are invited to prove <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190"
href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>their innocence by undergoing
ordeals. These are now harmless enough, such as attempting to cook rice
in a pot which has not been fired, but Turnbull says that he saw the
boiling oil ordeal in 1813 in Pudukk&#333;ttai territory. Perhaps the
most serious caste offence is adultery with a man of another community.
Turnbull says that women convicted of this used to be sentenced to be
killed by Chakkiliyans, but nowadays rigid excommunication is the
penalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kambalam caste is so called because, at caste council meetings,
a kambli (blanket) is spread, on which is placed a kalasam (brass
vessel) filled with water, and containing margosa (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves, and decorated with flowers.
Its mouth is closed by mango leaves and a cocoanut.</p>
<p>A correspondent writes to me that &ldquo;the Zamindars in the
western parts of Madura, and parts of Tinnevelly, are known as Kambala
Palayapat. If a man belongs to a Zamindar&rsquo;s family, he is said to
be of the R&#257;ja Kambala caste. The marriage ceremony is carried out
in two temporary huts erected outside the village, one for the
bridegroom, the other for the bride. The t&#257;li is tied round the
bride&rsquo;s neck by an elderly female or male belonging to the
family. If the marriage is contracted with a woman of an inferior
class, the bridegroom&rsquo;s hut is not made use of, and he does not
personally take part in the ceremony. A dagger (kattar), or rude sword,
is sent to represent him, and the t&#257;li is tied in the presence
thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a zamindari suit, details of which are published in the Madras
Law Reports, Vol. XVII, 1894, the Judge found that the
plaintiff&rsquo;s mother was married to the plaintiff&rsquo;s father in
the dagger form; that a dagger is used by the Sapt&#363;r Zamindars,
who are called Kattari <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>Kamaya, in the case of inequality
in the caste or social position of the bride; that, though the
customary rites of the Kambala caste were also performed, yet the use
of the dagger was an essential addition; and that, though she was of a
different and inferior caste to that of the plaintiff&rsquo;s father,
yet that did not invalidate the marriage. The defendant&rsquo;s
argument was that the dagger was used to represent the Zamindar
bridegroom as he did not attend in person, and that, by his
non-attendance, there could have been no joining of hands, or other
essential for constituting a valid marriage. The plaintiff argued that
the nuptial rites were duly performed, the Zamindar being present; that
the dagger was there merely as an ornament; and that it was customary
for people of the Zamindar&rsquo;s caste to have a dagger paraded on
the occasion of marriages. The Judge found that the dagger was there
for the purpose of indicating that the two ladies, whom the Zamindar
married, were of an inferior caste and rank.</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that, when
a Tottiyan girl attains maturity, &ldquo;she is kept in a separate hut,
which is watched by a Chakkiliyan. Marriage is either infant or adult.
A man has the usual claim to his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter, and so
rigorously is this rule followed that boys of tender years are
frequently married to grown women. These latter are allowed to consort
with their husband&rsquo;s near relations, and the boy is held to be
the father of any children which may be born. Weddings last three days,
and involve very numerous ceremonies. They take place in a special
pandal erected in the village, on either side of which are smaller
pandals for the bride and bridegroom. Two uncommon rites are the
slaughtering of a red ram without blemish, and marking the foreheads
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>of the couple with its blood, and the pursuit by
the bridegroom, with a bow and arrow, of a man who pretends to flee,
but is at length captured and bound. The ram is first sprinkled with
water, and, if it shivers, this, as usual, is held to be a good omen.
The bride-price is seven kalams of kumbu (<i lang="la-x-bio">Pennisetum
typhoideum</i>), and the couple may eat only this grain and horse-gram
until the wedding is over. A bottu (marriage badge) is tied round the
bride&rsquo;s neck by the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the marriage ceremonies of the Yerrakollas, I gather
that, on the betrothal day, kumbu must be cooked. Food is given to
seven people belonging to seven different septs. They are then
presented with betel leaves and areca nuts and four annas tied in a
cloth, and the approaching marriage is announced. On the wedding day,
the bride and bridegroom are seated on planks on the marriage dais, and
milk is sprinkled over them by people of their own sex. A few hours
later, the bridegroom takes his seat in the pandal, whither the bride
is brought in the arms of her maternal uncle. She sits by the side of
the bridegroom, and the Mettu N&#257;yakan links together the little
fingers of the contracting couple, and tells them to exchange rings.
This is the binding portion of the ceremony, and no bottu is tied round
the bride&rsquo;s neck. At a marriage among the Vekkiliyans, two huts
are constructed in an open space outside the village, in front of which
a pandal is erected, supported by twelve posts, and roofed with leafy
twigs of the pongu tree and <i lang="la-x-bio">Mimusops hexandra</i>.
On the following day, the bride and bridegroom are conducted to the
huts, the bride being sometimes carried in the arms of her maternal
uncle. They worship the ancestral heroes, who are represented by new
cloths folded, and placed on a tray. The bridegroom&rsquo;s sister ties
the bottu <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>on the bride&rsquo;s neck inside her hut, in
front of which kumbu grain is scattered. Betel and a fanam (coin) are
placed in the bride&rsquo;s lap. On the third day the bridegroom is
dressed up, and, mounting a horse, goes, accompanied by the marriage
pots, three times round the huts. He then enters the bride&rsquo;s hut,
and she is carried in the arms of the cousins of the bridegroom thrice
round the huts. The contracting couple then sit on planks, and the
cousins, by order of the Mettu N&#257;yakan, link their little fingers
together. They then enter the bridegroom&rsquo;s hut, and a mock
ploughing ceremony is performed. Coming out from the hut, they take up
a child, and carry it three times round the huts. This is, it is said,
done because, in former days, the Tottiyan bride and bridegroom had to
remain in the marriage huts till a child was born, because the Mettu
N&#257;yakan was so busy that he had no time to complete the marriage
ceremony until nearly a year had elapsed.</p>
<p>At a wedding among the nomad Tottiyans, a fowl is killed near the
marriage (arav&#275;ni) pots, and with its blood a mark is made on the
foreheads of the bride and bridegroom on their entry into the booths.
The Vekkiliyans sacrifice a goat or sheep instead of a fowl, and the
more advanced among them substitute the breaking of a cocoanut for the
animal sacrifice.</p>
<p>In connection with marriage, Mr. Hemingway writes that &ldquo;the
Tottiyans very commonly marry a young boy to a grown woman, and, as
among the Konga Vell&#257;las, the boy&rsquo;s father takes the duties
of a husband upon himself until the boy is grown up. Married women are
allowed to bestow their favours upon their husbands&rsquo; relations,
and it is said to be an understood thing that a man should not enter
his dwelling, if he sees another&rsquo;s slippers placed outside as a
sign that the owner of them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=
"#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>is with the mistress of the house.
Intercourse with men of another caste is, however, punished by
expulsion, and widows and unmarried girls who go astray are severely
dealt with. Formerly, it is said, they were killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a Tottiyan funeral, fire is carried to the burning-ground by a
Chakkiliyan, and the pyre is lighted, not by the sons, but by the
sammandhis (relations by marriage).</p>
<p>The Tottiyans of the Madura district observe the worship of
ancestors, who are represented by a number of stones set up somewhere
within the village boundaries. Such places are called m&#257;l&#275;.
According to Mr. Hemingway, when a member of the caste dies, some of
the bones are buried in this shed, along with a coin, and a stone is
planted on the spot. The stones are arranged in an irregular circle.
The circles of the Yerrakollas are exceedingly simple, and recall to
mind those of the N&#257;y&#257;dis of Malabar, but without the tree.
The stones are set up in an open space close to the burning-ground.
When a death occurs, a stone is erected among the ashes of the deceased
on the last day of the funeral ceremonies (karm&#257;ndhiram), and
worshipped. It is immediately transferred to the ancestral circle. The
m&#257;l&#275; of the Vekkiliyan section of the Tottiyans consists of a
massive central wooden pillar, carved with male and female human
figures, set up in a cavity in a round boulder, and covered over by a
conical canopy supported on pillars. When this canopy is set in motion,
the central pillar appears to be shaking. This illusion, it is claimed,
is due to the power of the ancestral gods. All round the central
pillar, which is about ten feet high, a number of stones of different
sizes are set up. The central pillar represents Jakkamma and other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>remote ancestors. The surrounding stones are the
representatives of those who have died in recent times. Like the
Yerrakollas, the Vekkiliyans erect a stone on the karm&#257;ndhiram day
at the spot where the body was cremated, but, instead of transferring
it at once to the ancestral circle, they wait till the day of
periodical m&#257;l&#275; worship, which, being an expensive
ceremonial, may take place only once in twelve years. If the interval
is long, the number of stones representing those who have died
meanwhile may be very large. News of the approaching m&#257;l&#275;
worship is sent to the neighbouring villages, and, on the appointed
day, people of all castes pour in, bringing with them several hundred
bulls. The hosts supply their guests with fodder, pots, and a liberal
allowance of sugar-cane. Refusal to bestow sugar-cane freely would
involve failure of the object of the ceremonial. After the completion
of the worship, the bulls are let loose, and the animal which reaches
the m&#257;l&#275; first is decorated, and held in reverence. Its owner
is presented with cloths, money, etc. The ceremony may be compared with
that of selecting the king bull among the K&#257;ppiliyans.</p>

<p>Self-cremation is said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3438src" href=
"#xd21e3438" name="xd21e3438src">62</a> to have been &ldquo;habitually
practiced by Tottiya widows in the times anterior to British
domination; and great respect was always shown to the memory of such as
observed the custom. Small tombs termed thipanjank&#333;vil (fire-torch
temple) were erected in their honour on the high-roads, and at these
oblations were once a year offered to the manes of the deceased
heroines. Sati was not, however, compulsory among them, and, if a widow
lived at all times a perfectly chaste and religious life, she was
honoured equally with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href=
"#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>such as performed the rite.&rdquo;
It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that &ldquo;sati
was formerly very common in the caste, and the two caste goddesses,
Jakkamma and Bommayya, are deifications of women who thus sacrificed
themselves. Every four years a festival is held in their honour, one of
the chief events in which is a bullock race. The owner of the winning
animal receives a prize, and gets the first betel and nut during the
feast. The caste god is Perum&#257;l, who is worshipped in the form of
a curry-grinding stone. The story goes that, when the Tottiyans were
fleeing to the south, one of their women found her grinding-stone so
intolerably heavy that she threw it away. It, however, re-appeared in
her basket. Thrown away again, it once more re-appeared, and she then
realised that the caste god must be accompanying them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tottiyans,&rdquo; Mr. Hemingway writes, &ldquo;do not
recognise the superiority of Br&#257;hmans, or employ them as priests
at marriages or funerals. They are deeply devoted to their own caste
deities. Some of these are Bommaka and Mallamma (the spirits of women
who committed sati long ago), V&#299;rak&#257;ran or V&#299;ram&#257;ti
(a bridegroom who was killed in a fight with a tiger), Patt&#257;lamma
(who helped them in their flight from the north), and M&#257;lai
Tambir&#257;n, the god of ancestors. Muttalamma and Jakkamma are also
found. M&#257;lai Tambir&#257;n is worshipped in the m&#257;l&#275;.
The Tottiyans are known for their uncanny devotion to sorcery and
witchcraft. All of them are supposed to possess unholy powers,
especially the Nalla Gollas, and they are much dreaded by their
neighbours. They do not allow any stranger to enter their villages with
shoes on, or on horseback, or holding up an umbrella, lest their god
should be offended. It is generally believed that, if any <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>one
breaks this rule, he will be visited with illness or some other
punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3449width" id="pl7-197"><img src=

</div>
<p>The Tottiyans have attached to them a class of beggars called
Pichiga v&#257;du, concerning whose origin the following legend is
narrated. There were, once upon a time, seven brothers and a sister
belonging to the Irriv&#257;ru exogamous sept. The brothers went on a
pilgrimage to Benares, leaving their sister behind. One day, while she
was bathing, a sacred bull (Nandi) left its sperm on her cloth, and she
conceived. Her condition was noticed by her brothers on their return,
and, suspecting her of immorality, they were about to excommunicate
her. But they discovered some cows in calf as the result of
parthenogenesis, and six of the brothers were satisfied as to the
girl&rsquo;s innocence. The seventh, however, required further proof.
After the child was born, it was tied to a branch of a dead chilla tree
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Strychnos potatorum</i>), which at once burst into
leaf and flower. The doubting brother became a cripple, and his
descendants are called Pichiga v&#257;ru, and those of the baby Chilla
v&#257;ru.</p>
<p><b>Traivarnika</b> (third caste men).&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, as a section of K&#333;matis (who claim to be
Vaisyas, or members of the third caste of Manu), who follow the details
of Br&#257;hmanical customs more scrupulously than the others. They are
described, in the Vizagapatam Manual, as followers of the
R&#257;m&#257;nuja faith, who deal chiefly in gold and silver, and
ornaments made thereof.</p>
<p><b>Triputa</b> (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ipom&aelig;a Turpethum</i>,
Indian jalap).&mdash;A sept of V&#299;ramushti.</p>
<p><b>Ts&#257;kala.</b>&mdash;The Ts&#257;kalas, S&#257;kalas, or
Ch&#257;kalas, who derive their name from ch&#257;ku (to wash), are the
washermen of the Telugu country, and also act as torch <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>and
palanquin bearers. In the Census Report, 1901, Tellakula (the white
class) is given as a synonym. The Rev. J. Cain writes<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3475src" href="#xd21e3475" name="xd21e3475src">63</a> that the
&ldquo;Tellakulavandlu are really washermen who, in consequence of
having obtained employment as peons (orderlies) in Government offices,
feel themselves to be superior to their old caste people. In their own
towns or villages they acknowledge themselves to be washermen, but in
other places they disclaim all such connection.&rdquo; It is noted in
the Kurnool Manual (1886) that, in the Cumbum division, &ldquo;they
serve as palanquin-bearers, and are always at the mercy of Government
officials, and are compelled to carry baggage for little or no wage.
Some are Inamdars (landholders), while others work for
wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ordinary Ts&#257;kalas are called B&#257;na Ts&#257;kala, in
contradistinction to the G&#363;na or Velama Ts&#257;k&#257;la.
B&#257;na is the Telugu name for the large pot, which the washermen use
for boiling the clothes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3480src" href=
"#xd21e3480" name="xd21e3480src">64</a> The G&#363;na Ts&#257;kalas are
dyers. In a note on the Velamas, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3484src" href="#xd21e3484" name=
"xd21e3484src">65</a> that &ldquo;some say they form a sub-division of
the Balijas, but this they themselves most vehemently deny, and the
Balijas derisively call them G&#363;ni S&#257;kalav&#257;ndlu
(hunchbacked washermen). The pride and jealousy of Hindu castes was
amusingly illustrated by the Velamas of K&#257;lahasti. The Deputy
Tahsildar of that town was desired to ascertain the origin of the name
G&#363;ni S&#257;kalav&#257;ndlu, but, as soon as he asked the
question, a member of the caste lodged a complaint of defamation
against him before the District Magistrate. The nickname appears to
have been applied to them because in the northern districts some print
chintz, and, carrying their goods in a bundle on their backs, walk
stooping <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>like a laden washerman. This derivation is more
than doubtful, for, in the God&#257;vari district, the name is
G&#363;na S&#257;kalav&#257;ndlu, g&#363;na being the large pot in
which they dye the chintzes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like other Telugu castes, the Ts&#257;kalas have exogamous septs or
intip&#275;ru, among which ch&#299;mala (ant) is of common occurrence.
Members of the gummadi sept do not cultivate, or eat the fruit of
<i lang="la-x-bio">Cucurbita maxima</i> (gummadi), and those of the
magili pula g&#333;tra avoid the fruit of <i lang="la-x-bio">Pandanus
fascicularis</i>. In like manner, sword beans (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Canavalia ensiformis</i>) may not be eaten by those who
belong to the thamballa g&#333;tra.</p>
<p>Among the sub-divisions of the caste are Reddi Bh&#363;mi (Reddi
earth), Murikin&#257;ti, P&#257;kan&#257;ti (eastern country),
D&#275;sa, and Golkonda. Of these, some are also sub-divisions of other
Telugu classes, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>D&#275;sa or D&#275;s&#363;r Balija&mdash;K&#257;pu.</p>
<p>Murikin&#257;ti or Murikin&#257;du&mdash;Kamsala, Mangala, M&#257;la
and R&#257;zu.</p>
<p>P&#257;kan&#257;ti&mdash;Balija, Golla, Kamsala, K&#257;pu, and
M&#257;la.</p>
<p>Reddi Bh&#363;mi&mdash;M&#257;la, Mangala.</p>
<p>At the census, 1891, Odde was recorded as a sub-division of the
Ts&#257;kalas, and it is noted in the Vizagapatam Manual (1869) that
the Vadde or Odde Cakali wash clothes, and carry torches in that
district. The name Odde Ts&#257;kala refers to Oriya-speaking
washermen. Telugus call the Oriya country &#332;dra or Odde d&#275;sam
and Oriyas &#332;dra or Odde V&#257;ndlu.</p>
<p>Like the Tamil Vann&#257;ns, the Ts&#257;kalas prepare for various
castes torches for processional or other ceremonial occasions, and the
face cloth, and paddy piled up at the head of a corpse, are their
perquisite. The Reddi Bh&#363;mi and other sub-divisions wash the
clothes of all classes, except M&#257;las and M&#257;dig&#257;s, while
the D&#275;sa and Golkonda <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href=
"#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>sub-divisions will wash for both
M&#257;las and M&#257;dig&#257;s, provided that the clothes are steeped
in water, and not handed to them, but left therein, to be taken by the
washerman. Every village has its families of washermen, who, in return
for their services, receive an allowance of grain once a year, and may
have land allotted to them. Whenever a goat or fowl has to be
sacrificed to a deity, it is the privilege of the Ts&#257;kala to cut
off the head, or wring the neck of the animal. When K&#257;pu women go
on a visit to a distant village, they are accompanied by a
Ts&#257;kala. At a K&#257;pu wedding, a small party of K&#257;pus,
taking with them some food and gingelly (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Sesamum</i>) oil, proceed in procession to the house of a
Ts&#257;kala, in order to obtain from him a <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e3520" title="Source: famework">framework</span> made of bamboo or
sticks, over which cotton threads (dhornam) are wound, and the Ganga
idol, which is kept in his custody. The food is presented to him, and
some rice poured into his cloth. Receiving these things, he says that
he cannot find the dhornam and idol without a torch-light, and demands
gingelly oil. This is given to him, and the K&#257;pus return with the
Ts&#257;kala carrying the dhornam and idol to the marriage house. The
Ts&#257;kala is asked to tie the dhornam to the pandal (marriage booth)
or roof of the house, and he demands some paddy (unhusked rice) which
is heaped up on the ground. Standing thereon, he ties the dhornam. At a
Panta K&#257;pu wedding, the Ganga idol, together with a goat and
k&#257;vadi (bamboo pole), with baskets of rice, cakes, betel leaves
and areca nuts, is carried in procession to a pond or temple. The
washerman, dressed up as a woman, heads the procession, and keeps on
dancing and singing till the destination is reached. At the conclusion
of the ceremonial, he takes charge of the idol, and goes his way. Among
the Panta Reddis of the Tamil country, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>the idol is taken in
procession by the washerman, who goes to every Reddi house, and
receives a present of money. At a wedding among the &#298;digas (Telugu
toddy-drawers), the brother of the bride is fantastically dressed, with
margosa (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves in his
turban, and carries a bow and arrow. This kodangi (buffoon) is
conducted in procession to the temple by a few married women, and made
to walk over cloths spread on the ground by the village washerman. The
cloth worn by a K&#257;pu girl at the time of her first menstrual
ceremony is the perquisite of the washerwoman.</p>
<p>The tribal deity of the Ts&#257;kalas is Madiv&#257;layya, in whose
honour a feast, called Mailar or Mailar Pandaga, is held in January
immediately after the Pongal festival. Small models of pots, slabs of
stone such as are used for beating the wet clothes on, and other
articles used in their work, are made in rice and flour paste. After
they have been worshipped, fruits, cooked vegetables, etc., are
offered, and a sheep or goat is sacrificed. Some of its blood is mixed
with the food, of which a little is sprinkled over the pots, stones,
etc., used during washing operations. If this ceremonial was not
observed, it is believed that the clothes, when boiling in the water
pot, would catch fire, and be ruined. The festival, which is not
observed by the D&#275;sa and Golkonda Ts&#257;kalas, lasts for five or
seven days, and is a time of holiday.</p>
<p>At the first menstrual ceremony, the maternal uncle of the girl has
to erect a hut made of seven different kinds of sticks, of which one
must be from a <i lang="la-x-bio">Strychnos Nux-vomica</i> tree. The
details of the marriage ceremony are very similar to those of the
Balijas and Kammas. The distribution of p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri, and the
tying of the dhornam to the pandal must be carried out by an assistant
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>headman called Gatamdar. On the last day, a goat
or sheep is sacrificed to the marriage pots. Liberal potations of toddy
are given to those who attend the wedding.</p>
<p>The Ts&#257;kalas have a caste beggar called Mail&#257;ri, or Patam,
because he carries a brass plate (patam) with the figure of a deity
engraved on it. He is said to be a Ling&#257;yat.</p>

<p><b>Tulabh&#257;ram.</b>&mdash;In his description<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3551src" href="#xd21e3551" name="xd21e3551src">66</a> of the
Tulabh&#257;ram or Tulapurushad&#257;nam ceremony performed by the
Mah&#257;r&#257;jas of Travancore, Mr. Shungoony Menon explains that
the latter word is a compound of three Sanskrit words, tula (scales),
purusha (man), and d&#257;nam (gift, particularly of a religious
character). And he gives the following description of the ceremonial,
for the performance of which a Tulamandapam is erected, wherein the
scales are set up, and the weighing and other rites performed. On the
eighth day &ldquo;after worshipping and making offerings, the
Mah&#257;r&#257;ja proceeds to the Tulamandapam, where, in the
south-east corner, he is sprinkled with puny&#257;ham water. Then he
goes to the side room, where the &lsquo;nine grains&rsquo; are sown in
silver flower pots, where the ach&#257;rya anoints him with nine
fresh-water kalasas. Thence the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja retires to the
palace, changes clothes, wears certain jewels specially made for the
occasion, and, holding the State sword in his right hand and the State
shield in his left, he proceeds to the pagoda; and, having presented a
bull elephant at the foot of the great golden flagstaff, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>silks, gold coins, jewels and other rich
offerings in the interior, he walks round by the Sevaimandapam, and
re-enters the Tulamandapam. He walks thrice round the scales,
prostrates himself before it, bows before the priests and elderly
relatives, and obtains their sanction to perform the
Tulapurushad&#257;nam. He then mounts the western scale, holding
Yama&rsquo;s and Surya&rsquo;s pratim&#257;s in his right and left hand
respectively. He sits facing to the east on a circular heavy plank cut
out of fresh jack-wood (<i lang="la-x-bio">Artocarpus
integrifolia</i>), and covered with silk. He repeats mantras (prayers)
in this position. The opposite or eastern scale then receives the gold,
both coined and in ingots, till it not only attains equality but
touches the ground, and the scale occupied by the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja
rises high. The Mah&#257;r&#257;ja then comes down, and, sitting facing
to the east, places the gold, the Tulupurusha pratim&#257; and other
pratim&#257;s, with flowers, sandal paste, etc., in a basin of water,
and, meditating on Brahma or the Supreme Being, he offers the contents
to Br&#257;hmans generically.&rdquo; Of the gold placed in the scale,
one-fourth is divided among the priests who conduct the ceremony, and
the remaining three-fourths are distributed among Br&#257;hmans. For
use in connection with the ceremony, gold coins, called tulabh&#257;ra
k&#257;su, are specially struck. They bear on one side the
Malay&#257;lam legend Sr&#299; Padman&#257;bha, and on the other a
chank shell.</p>
<p>In connection with the tulabh&#257;ram ceremony as performed at the
temple of K&#257;li, the goddess of cholera and small-pox at Cranganore
in the Cochin State, Mr. T. K. Gopal Panikkar writes as
follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3561src" href="#xd21e3561" name=
"xd21e3561src">67</a> &ldquo;When a man is taken ill of any infectious
disease, his relations generally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204"
href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>pray to this goddess for his
recovery, solemnly covenanting to perform what goes by the name of a
thulabh&#257;ram ceremony. The process consists in placing the patient
in one of the scale-pans of a huge balance, and weighing him against
gold or more generally pepper (and sometimes other substances as well)
deposited in the other scale-pan. Then this weight of the substance is
offered to the goddess. This is to be performed right in front of the
goddess in the temple yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with weighing ceremonies, it may be noted that, at
Mulki in South Canara, there is a temple of Venkat&#275;swara, which is
maintained by Konkani Br&#257;hmans. A Konkani Br&#257;hman, who is
attached to the temple, becomes inspired almost daily between 10 and 11
<span class="sc">A.M.</span> immediately after p&#363;ja (worship), and
people consult him. Some time ago, a rich merchant (a Baniya from
Gujarat) consulted the inspired man (Darsana) as to what steps should
be taken to enable his wife to be safely delivered. The Darsana told
him to take a vow that he would present to the god of the temple
silver, sugar-candy, and date fruits, equal in weight to that of his
wife. This he did, and his wife was delivered of a male child. The cost
of the ceremonial is said to have been five thousand rupees.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tulab&#299;na.</span>&mdash;The Tulab&#299;nas are
a class of cotton-cleaners, who are scattered over the Ganjam district,
and said to be more numerous in Cuttack. It is suggested that the name
is derived from tula, the beam of a balance, and b&#299;na (or
v&#299;na) a stringed musical instrument. The apparatus used by them in
cleaning cotton, which bears a fanciful resemblance to a v&#299;na, is
suspended by a rope so that it is properly balanced, and the gut-string
thereof struck with a dumb-bell shaped implement, to set it vibrating.

equivalent Tulumar is recorded as a sub-caste of M&#257;vilan, which
speaks Tulu.</p>
<p>Concerning the Tuluva Vell&#257;las, Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3594src" href="#xd21e3594" name=

<p class="first"><b>Ud&#257;si.</b>&mdash;A few members of this Central
India sect of religious mendicants and devotees have been returned at
times of census. It is said to have been founded three hundred years
ago by one Gop&#257;ldas.</p>
<p><b>Udaiya.</b>&mdash;Udaiya, meaning lord, is the title of many
well-to-do Ling&#257;yats and of some Jains, and Udaiya or Wodeiyar
occurs as the name of a Ling&#257;yat sub-division of the Badagas of
the N&#299;ligiri hills. The Mah&#257;r&#257;jas of Mysore belong to
the Wodeiyar dynasty, which was restored after the Muhammadan
usurpation of Haidar &#256;li and T&#299;pu Sultan. The name of the
present Mahar&#257;ja is Sr&#299; Krishna R&#257;ja Wodeiyar
Bah&#257;dur.</p>
<p><b>Udaiy&#257;n.</b>&mdash;It is noted in the Madras Census Report,
1891, that &ldquo;the four Tamil castes Nattam&#257;n, Malaim&#257;n,
Sudarm&#257;n (or Suruthim&#257;n), and Udaiy&#257;n are closely
connected. The last is probably a title rather than a caste, and is the
usual agnomen of the Nattam&#257;ns, Malaim&#257;ns, and
Sudarm&#257;ns, as also of the potter caste (Kusavan). Nattam&#257;n
means a man of the plains, Malaim&#257;n a man of the hills, and
Sudarm&#257;n one who does good, a hero. Nattampadi is another form of
Nattam&#257;n. Tradition traces the descent of the three castes from a
certain D&#275;va R&#257;ja, a Ch&#275;ra king, who had three wives, by
each of whom he had a son, and these were the ancestors of the three
castes. There are other stories, but all agree in ascribing the origin
of the castes to a single progenitor of the Ch&#275;ra dynasty. It
seems probable that they are descendants of the V&#275;dar soldiers of
the Kongu country, who were induced to settle in the eastern districts
of the Ch&#275;ra kingdom. Additional evidence of the important
position they once held is afforded by the titles Pandariy&#257;r,
Pand&#257;r&#257;tt&#257;r (custodians of the treasury), which some of
them still use. Some of them again are locally styled Poligars
(P&#257;layakk&#257;ran) by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>the ordinary ryots, and the title
K&#257;valgar is not infrequent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Udaiy&#257;ns, Malaiyam&#257;ns, Nattam&#257;ns,
and Sudarm&#257;ns of the Trichinopoly district, Mr. F. R. Hemingway
writes as follows. &ldquo;Though, in the Census Report, 1901, they are
shown as separate castes, in this district they are endogamous
sub-divisions of one and the same caste, namely the Udaiy&#257;ns. The
three sub-divisions are unanimous in saying that they are the
descendants of the three Paraiyan foster-daughters of the poetess
Auvaiyar, all of whom became the wives of the king of Tirukkoyil&#363;r
in South Arcot, a certain Daivika, who was warned that only by marrying
these women could he save his family from disaster. The Ch&#333;la,
P&#257;ndya, and Ch&#275;ra kings were present at the wedding, and, on
their blessing the bridegroom and his brides, they were themselves
blessed by the poetess, to whom the Ch&#275;ra kingdom owes its
unfailing rain, the Ch&#333;la country its rice fields, and the
P&#257;ndyan realm its cotton. The poorness of the last blessing is due
to the fact that the P&#257;ndya king was slow to offer his good
wishes. The three sub-divisions eat together, and recognise the tie of
a common descent, but do not intermarry. The section called
Arisakk&#257;ra Nattam&#257;n is looked down upon by the rest, and may
not intermarry with any of them. All have well-defined exogamous
sub-divisions, called k&#257;nis, derived from places where their
different ancestors are supposed to have lived, <i>e.g.</i>,
Kolatt&#363;r, Kannan&#363;r, Ariyal&#363;r. The Udaiy&#257;ns put on
sacred threads at marriages and funerals, and some of them have
recently begun to wear them always. They are generally cultivators,
and, with the exception of the Sudarm&#257;ns, who are supposed to have
a turn for crime, are law-abiding citizens. One section of the
Sudarm&#257;ns, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208"
name="pb208">208</a>]</span>the M&#363;ppans of Kapistalam in Tanjore,
have a bad reputation for criminality. A curious practice is that,
before arranging a marriage, it is customary for the bride&rsquo;s
party to go to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, to dine with him, and test
his health by seeing how much he can eat. They allow a boy, whose suit
for the hand of a girl within certain degrees of relationship is
refused by her parents, to marry the girl, notwithstanding, by tying a
t&#257;li (marriage emblem) round her neck. They also permit the
betrothal of infants, the form observed being to present the child with
a new cloth and a mat, and to apply sacred ashes to its forehead. At
their funerals, the mourning party has to chew some rice and spit it
out on the return from the burning-ground, and, on the sixteenth day,
the widow is made to worship a light, and to touch a salt pot. The
Nattam&#257;n women do not, as a rule, cover their breasts. The lobes
of their ears are very distended, and they tattoo their chins and
cheeks in the Paraiyan fashion. This is supposed to be in recollection
of their origin. The Malaiyam&#257;n women wear their t&#257;li on a
golden wire instead of on a thread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Udaiy&#257;ns,&rdquo; Mr. Francis writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3646src" href="#xd21e3646" name="xd21e3646src">1</a>
are a caste, which is specially numerous in South Arcot. Most of them
are cultivators, and in Kallakurchi many are also money-lenders on a
large scale. They adopt numerous different titles in an indiscriminate
way, and four brothers have been known to call themselves respectively
N&#257;yak, Pillai, Mudali, and Udaiy&#257;n. They have three
sub-divisions&mdash;Malaiyam&#257;n, Nattam&#257;n, and
Sudarm&#257;n&mdash;which all admit that they are descended from one
common stock, will usually dine together, but do not intermarry. Some
of the caste, however, are now turning <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>vegetarians, and
these will not only not eat with the others, but will not let their
girls marry them. They do not, nevertheless, object to their sons
taking brides from the meat-eating classes, and thus provide an
interesting, if small, instance of the (on this coast) uncommon
practice of hypergamy. In all general matters the ways of the three
sub-divisions are similar. Sudarm&#257;ns are uncommon in this
district, and are stated to be chiefly found in Trichinopoly and
Tanjore. The Udaiy&#257;ns say that the three groups are the
descendants of a king who once ruled at Tirukk&#333;yil&#363;r, the
first of whom took the hilly part of his father&rsquo;s country, and so
was called Malaiyam&#257;n; the second the level tracts, whence his
name Nattam&#257;n, and the third was the scholar of the family, and
learned in the holy books (srutas), and so was called Sudarm&#257;n.
These Udaiy&#257;ns are the caste from which were drawn some of the
k&#257;valg&#257;rs (watchmen) who, in pre-British days, were appointed
to perform police duties, and keep the country clear of thieves; and
some of the descendants of these men, who are known to their neighbours
as poligars, and still have considerable local influence, are even now
to be met with. The connection of the members of the caste with the
V&#275;p&#363;r (criminal) Paraiyans, which is of course confined to
the less reputable sections among them, seems to have had its origin in
the days when they were still head k&#257;valg&#257;rs, and these
Paraiyans were their talaiy&#257;ris, entrusted, under their orders,
with police duties in the different villages. It now consists in acting
as receivers of the property these people steal, and in protecting them
in diverse ways&mdash;finding and feeing a vakil (law pleader) for
their defence, for instance&mdash;when they are in trouble with the
police. It is commonly declared that their relations are sometimes of a
closer nature, and that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href=
"#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>wives of V&#275;pp&#363;r
Paraiyans who are in enforced retirement are cared for by the
Udaiy&#257;ns. To this is popularly attributed the undoubted fact that
these Paraiyans are often much fairer in complexion than other members
of that caste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The village of Mangalam in the South Arcot district is
&ldquo;chiefly interesting on account of its being the only village in
the district where buffalo sacrifices on any scale are still regularly
made. Buffaloes are dedicated to the K&#257;li shrine in Mangalam even
by persons in the Salem, Tanjore and Trichinopoly districts, and the
village is commonly known as M&#257;duvetti Mangalam, or
buffalo-sacrificing Mangalam. When a man or any of his belongings gets
seriously sick, he consecrates an animal to this shrine, and, if the
illness ends favourably, it is sent to its fate at the temple on the
date of the annual sacrifice (May-June). When the buffalo is dedicated,
a piece of saffron-coloured cloth, in which is placed some small coin
and a cadjan (palm) leaf containing an announcement of the dedication,
is tied to its horns, and it is allowed to roam wherever it likes
through the fields. On the day of the sacrifice, fourteen of the best
of the animals which have been dedicated and brought to the temple are
selected, and seven of them are tied to an equal number of stone posts
in front of the goddess&rsquo; shrine. The p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest),
who is an Udaiy&#257;n by caste, then walks down the line, and beheads
them one after the other. The goddess is next taken round on a car,
and, on her return to the temple, the other seven buffaloes are
similarly killed. The animals which are not selected are sold, and the
proceeds paid into the temple treasury. There are two images in the
temple, one of K&#257;li, and the other, which is placed at the back of
the shrine, of Mangalay&#257;chi. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>latter goddess does
not approve of animal sacrifices, and, while the above ceremonies are
proceeding, a blanket is hung in front of her so that she may not see
them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3657src" href="#xd21e3657"
name="xd21e3657src">2</a></p>
<p>It is noted by Bishop Whitehead that, a few years ago, an untoward
event occurred in connection with a Pid&#257;ri festival at a village
in the Trichinopoly district. &ldquo;The festival had commenced, and
the p&#363;j&#257;ri had tied the kapu (cord dyed with turmeric) on his
wrist, when a dispute arose between the trustees of the shrine, which
caused the festival to be stopped. The dispute could not be settled,
and the festival was suspended for three years, and, during all that
time, there could be no marriages among the Udaya caste, while the poor
p&#363;j&#257;ri, with the kapu on his wrist, had to remain the whole
of the three years in the temple, not daring to go out lest Pid&#257;ri
in her wrath should slay him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, that &ldquo;the
Nattam&#257;ns say they originally settled in South Arcot, and then
spread to Tanjore and Trichinopoly, and finally to Madura, and this
theory is supported by the fact that they have fifteen exogamous
sub-divisions called k&#257;nis or fields, which are all named after
villages (<i>e.g.</i>, Ariyal&#363;r, Puthth&#363;r) in the first three
of these districts. A man has a right to marry the daughter of his
father&rsquo;s sister, and, if she is given to another man, the
father&rsquo;s sister has to return to her father or brother the dowry
which she received at the time of her marriage, and this is given to
the man who had the claim upon the girl. The same custom occurs among
the Kuravans and the Kallans. The eldest son in each family has to be
named after the god of the village which gives its name to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>k&#257;ni or sept to which the family belongs,
and the child is usually taken to that village to be named. Marriage is
infant or adult. Widow marriage is forbidden. Br&#257;hmans are
employed for ceremonies, but these are not received on terms of
equality by other Br&#257;hmans. Both cremation and burial are
practised. Vell&#257;las will eat with Nattam&#257;ns. The caste title
is Udaiy&#257;n.&rdquo; Another title is Nayinar, which is also used by
Pallis and Jains. There is a proverb &ldquo;Nattumuththinal
Nayinar&rdquo;, <i>i.e.</i>, when the Nattam&#257;n ripens, he is a
Nayinar. At the census, 1901, some Nattam&#257;ns returned themselves
as Natramiludaiy&#257;n, meaning the repository of chaste Tamil; and
&#362;r-Udaiy&#257;n (lord of a village) was given as their caste name.
Nattam&#257;n also occurs as a sub-division of the Pallis.</p>
<p>Under the name Nattam&#257;di, the Nattam&#257;ns are described in
the Tanjore Manual as &ldquo;peasant population. Some are ryotwari
land-holders in their own right and possess large estates. The word is
derived from nattam, village, and is used in three forms, Nattamakkal,
Nattamar, and Nattam&#257;di. A considerable proportion are converts to
the Roman Catholic religion, and, in the neighbourhood of Vallam, there
are very few who profess any other faith.&rdquo; In the Madura Manual,
the Nattamb&#257;diyans are further described as being &ldquo;usually
respectable cultivators. They are said to have emigrated into the
Madura country not more than about eight years ago. They are an
interesting class of Tamils, inasmuch as very many of them have adopted
the Roman Catholic faith under the leadership of the Jesuit
missionaries. They are said to be a fine race physically; finer even
than the Vell&#257;lans. They are also called Udaiyans, and tradition
says that they came from the Toreiyur n&#257;du or district in Tanjore,
from a village called Udeiy&#257;p&#257;leiyam. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>are
chiefly resident in the great zamind&#257;ris, and contrast favourably
with the Maravans, being very orderly, frugal, and
industrious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am informed that Nattam&#257;n women will do cooly work and carry
food for their husbands when at work in the fields, but that
Malaim&#257;n women will not do so.</p>
<p>The Sudarm&#257;ns are described, in the Madras Census Report, 1901,
as &ldquo;cultivators chiefly found in the districts of Tanjore and
Trichinopoly. They are imitating the Br&#257;hmans and Vell&#257;las in
their social customs, and some of them have left off eating meat, with
the idea of raising themselves in general estimation; but they
nevertheless eat in the houses of Kallans and Idaiyans. Their title is
M&#363;ppan.&rdquo; Some Sudarm&#257;ns, I am told, have become
Agamudaiyans.</p>
<p><b>Udd&#257;ri.</b>&mdash;A synonym for the village

powers of village policeman were conferred on the Ugr&#257;ni, who now
wears a brass badge on his arm, with the words Village Police in the
vernacular engraved on it. It is the duty of the Ugr&#257;ni to report
the following to the village magistrate:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The commission of grave crimes, such as theft, house-breaking,
robbery, dacoity, accidental deaths, suicides, etc. <span class=

<p>4. The arrival or residence in the village of any person whom the
villagers suspect to be a bad character.</p>
<p>5. The commission of mischief in respect of any public property,
such as roads, road avenues, bridges, cattle pounds, Government trees
on unreserved lands, etc.</p>
<p><b>&#362;liyak&#257;ran.</b>&mdash;A synonym, denoting menial
servant, of Pariv&#257;ram.</p>
<p><b>Ull&#257;dan.</b>&mdash;It is recorded, in the Travancore Census
Report, 1901, that &ldquo;the Ull&#257;tans and N&#257;y&#257;tis are
found in the low country, as well as on the hills. At a remote period,
certain Ull&#257;ta families from the plains settled themselves at
Talpurakk&#333;tta near Sabarimala, and even to-day pilgrims to
Sabarimala consider this place as sacred. In the low country, the
offerings to the same deities as the Ull&#257;tans worship are offered
by the V&#257;lans. Hence the Ull&#257;tans were called by them
Kochchuv&#257;lans. The place near Sabarimala where they once dwelt is
known as Kochuv&#257;lakkuti, or the cottage of the Kochchuv&#257;lan.
Most of these Ull&#257;tans have left this place for fear of wild
beasts, and are now straying in the woods with no fixed abode. It is
said that they are the descendants from a Namb&#363;tiri woman, who, on
being proclaimed an outcast, said Ullat&#257;na, meaning that (the
offence for which she was ostracised) is true. [According to another
derivation, the name is derived from ull, within, and otunnu, runs, and
means one who runs away into the forest at the sight of a member of any
of the higher castes.] They are good hunters, and experts in the
collection of wax and other forest produce. A <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>curious marriage custom, prevalent among them,
is thus related by Dr. Day. &lsquo;A large round building is made of
leaves, and inside this the bride is ensconced. All the eligible young
men of the village then assemble, and form a ring round this hut. At a
short distance sits the girl&rsquo;s father or the nearest male
relative with tom-tom in his hands, and a few more musical instruments
complete the scene. Presently the music begins. The young men, each
armed with a bamboo, commence dancing round the hut, into which each of
them thrusts his stick. This continues about an hour, when the owner of
whichever bamboo she seizes becomes the fortunate husband of the
concealed bride. A feast then follows.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3732src" href="#xd21e3732" name="xd21e3732src">3</a> They subsist
chiefly on fruits, wild yams, and other forest products, and eke out a
wretched existence. When armed with guns, they make excellent
sportsmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted by the Rev. S. Mateer<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3739src" href="#xd21e3739" name="xd21e3739src">4</a> that the
Ull&#257;dans &ldquo;subsist chiefly on wild yams, arrowroot, and other
esculents, which they find in the jungle, and for the grubbing up of
which they are generally armed with a long pointed staff. They also
further enjoy the fruits of the chase, and are adepts in the use of the
bow and arrow. The arrow they use has an iron spear-head, and an
Ull&#257;dan has been known to cut a wriggling cobra in half at the
first shot. They were claimed as the property of celebrated hill
temples, or great proprietors, who exacted service of them, and
sometimes sold their services to Nairs, Syrians, and others. A few
Ull&#257;dans in the low country say they or their fathers were stolen
in childhood, and brought down as slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Kottayam in Travancore, I came across a party of Ull&#257;dans
carrying cross-bows. These were said to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>used
for catching fish in rivers, lagoons, and tanks. The arrow is between
two and three feet in length, and has an iron hook at one end. Attached
to it is a thin but strong string, one end of which is tied to the
hook, while the other end passes through a small hole in the wooden
part of the arrow, and is fastened to the cross-bar of the bow. This
string is about thirty feet in length, and serves not only to drag the
captured fish out of the water, and land it, but also to prevent the
arrow from being lost. The origin of the cross-bow, which I have not
found in the possession of any other tribe, puzzled me until the word
Firingi was mentioned in connection with it. The use of this word would
seem to indicate that the cross-bow is a survival from the days of the
Portuguese on the west coast, Firingi (a Frank) or Parangi being used
by Natives for European or Portuguese.</p>
<p>For the following note on the Ull&#257;dans of the Cochin State, I
am indebted to Mr. L. K. Anantha Krishna Iyer.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3748src" href="#xd21e3748" name="xd21e3748src">5</a> &ldquo;Their
huts are situated in the forest of the plains, by the side of paddy
(rice) flats, or in cocoanut gardens remote from those of the members
of the higher castes. Only Christian Moplahs are found in the
neighbourhood. Their huts are erected on short bamboo posts, the roof
and four sides of which are covered with plaited cocoanut leaves. A
bamboo framework, of the same leaves, serves the purpose of a door. A
few plaited cocoanut leaves, and a mat of their own weaving, form the
only furniture, and serve as beds for them at night. Their vessels in
domestic use consist of a few earthen pots for cooking and keeping
water in, and a few shallow earthen dishes, from which they drink
water, and take their food. Some large pieces of the bark of the areca
palm, containing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217"
name="pb217">217</a>]</span>salt, chillies, etc., were also seen by me.
What little they possess as food and clothing is placed in small
baskets suspended from the framework of the roof by means of wooden
hooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The caste assembly consists of the elderly members of the
caste. There is a headman, who is called M&#363;ppan, and he has an
assistant who is known as Ponamban. The headman has to preside at all
marriage and funeral ceremonies, and to decide all disputes connected
with the caste. The caste assembly meets chiefly to deal with cases of
immorality. The guilty parties are summoned before the assembly. The
headman, who presides, inquires into the matter, and, in the event of
the accused parties confessing their guilt, they are taken before His
Highness the R&#257;ja, who is informed of the circumstances. The male
culprit is sometimes beaten or fined. The woman is given some water or
the milk of a green cocoanut, and this is supposed to set her free from
all sin. When a fine is imposed, it is sometimes spent on the purchase
of toddy, which is shared among the castemen present. The headman gets
a few puthans (Cochin coins) for his trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In religion, the Ull&#257;dans are pure animists or demon
worshippers. All cases of sickness, and other calamities, are
attributed to the malignant influence of demons, whom it is necessary
to propitiate. They worship Kappiri, Thikutti, and Ch&#257;than, all of
whom are represented by a few stones placed under a thatched roof
called kottil. Offerings of rice flour, sheep, fowls, toddy, rice,
cocoanuts and plantains, are given on Fridays in the month of Kanni
(September-October). One of the castemen acts as Velichap&#257;d
(oracle), and speaks as if by inspiration. He also casts out demons
from the bodies of women who are believed to be influenced by them.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>When he resumes his former self, he takes half
the offerings to himself, allowing the other half for distribution
among the bystanders. They also worship the spirits of the departed
members of their families, who, they think, sometimes appear to them in
dreams, and ask them for whatever they want. They believe that, in the
event of their neglecting to give what is asked, these spirits will
cause serious calamity to their family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ull&#257;dans generally bury their dead in special places
called chotala, but some of them bury the corpse a few yards away from
their huts. The young are buried deep in the ground, while the old ones
are buried not so deep. The dead body is placed on a new piece of cloth
spread on a bamboo bier, which is carried by the relatives to the
grave-yard. The castemen of the neighbourhood, including the relations
and friends of the deceased, accompany the bier to the burial-ground,
and return home after bathing. The members of the family fast for the
night. They observe pollution for fifteen days, and, on the morning of
the sixteenth day, the Thalippan (barber priest) comes and cleans the
huts and its surrounding, and sprinkles cow-dung mixed with water on
the members of the family as they return from bathing, in order that
they may be freed from pollution. They entertain their castemen on that
day. It is a custom among the Ull&#257;dans, Pulayas, and other low
classes, that, when they are invited to a feast, they bring with them
some rice, curry stuffs, toddy, or a few annas to meet the expenses of
the feast. Very often the above articles are obtained as a gift from
the charitably disposed members of the higher castes. At the end of the
year, a similar feast is given to the castemen. Among the
Ull&#257;dans, the nephew is the chief mourner, for he usually
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>succeeds to the property of the dead, and proves
his right of ownership by acting as the chief mourner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ull&#257;dans on the sea-coast make boats, and cut
timber. Their brethren in the interior gather honey, and collect minor
forest produce, and sell it to contractors. During the agricultural
season, they engage in every kind of agricultural work, such as
ploughing, sowing, transplanting, reaping, etc. They also graze the
cattle of the farmers. They get a few annas worth of paddy (unhusked
rice) for their labour. For most of the months in the year they are in
a half-starving condition, and resort to eating wild roots, and
animals, which they can get hold of (<i>e.g.</i>, rats, tortoises,
fish, or crocodiles). They know where rats are to be found. They thrust
a long stick into their holes, moving it so violently as to kill them
there, or forcing them to come out, when they catch and kill them. Very
often in the rural parts, both men and women are found with long poles
ready to be thrust into any holes there may be by the side of a fence,
or where bamboos are growing luxuriantly. They also catch crocodiles.
They place the carcase of a fowl, sheep, or other animal, on the bank
of a canal, or by the side of a tank where crocodiles are to be found.
Into it is thrust a pointed piece of iron, fastened to a long cord.
When a crocodile comes out of the water to eat it, or tries to get away
with it, the piece of iron is fixed firmly into its mouth, upon which
the Ull&#257;dans, who are watching, approach and kill it with their
clubs and knives. They catch fish by means of bait, and by poisoning
the water. They are also very skilful in spearing fish swimming near
the surface. They are more trackers of game than hunters, and very
often accompany Moplahs, who go out hunting to provide themselves with
meat of all kinds for feasts during their weddings. The Ull&#257;dans
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>are engaged only as beaters. For this service,
they are given meals during the wedding, in addition to three annas
worth of paddy for each beater. They are armed with clubs, and seldom
go with dogs, fearing that they may drive away the game. When any
animal is killed in hunting, the right side of the back of the animal
goes to the Government. It is given to the Forest Officer, who auctions
it, and the money obtained is sent to the t&#257;luk treasury. The left
side of the back goes to the member of the party who shoots the animal.
He also gets the face with the tongue. The headman among the
Ull&#257;dans also gets a share. The remainder of the carcase is
equally divided among the members who have formed the party. Should any
dispute arise regarding the division of the game, the man who shoots
the animal is entrusted with the settlement of the dispute, and his
decision is final. In cases where the hunting party is organised by the
Moplahs, the Ull&#257;dans get wages and meals for their trouble. In
places where elephant pits are dug, hunting is forbidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As regards their social status, the Ull&#257;dans, like the
N&#257;y&#257;dis, form the Chand&#257;las of the plains. Their
approach to within a radius of sixty-four feet pollutes Br&#257;hmans,
and all higher castes, including the S&#363;dras (N&#257;yars). The
Ull&#257;dans cannot walk along the public roads, or come to the
bazaars. Nor can they approach the precincts of any town or locality
where the members of higher castes reside. The Pulayas and Parayas
profess to be polluted by them. It is curious to note that the
Ull&#257;da women consider it degrading to go to work like the Pulaya
woman. They say that their husbands have to provide for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ulli</b> (onions or garlic).&mdash;A sub-division of the Tigala
market-gardeners. The equivalent Ullip&#333;yala occurs as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>an
exogamous sept of Golla, and Ulligadda as a sept of B&#333;ya and
Korava.</p>
<p><b>Ulumban.</b>&mdash;It is recorded in the Gazetteer of Malabar
that &ldquo;an endogamous sub-caste (of N&#257;yars) of foreign origin
are the Ulumbans or cowherds. According to one tradition, they were
originally immigrants from Dv&#257;raka (Guzerat). Their original
occupation still survives in the privileges of supplying ghee
(clarified butter) for the abhish&#275;gam or libation at the great
annual festival at the jungle shrine of K&#333;ttiyur, and of supplying
butter-milk to the Tiruvang&#257;d temple at Tellicherry, which are
exercised by families of this caste; and in the general privilege of
offering milk in any temple without previous ablution.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Uluvala</b> (seeds of horse-gram: <i lang="la-x-bio">Dolichos

<p><b>Ungara.</b>&mdash;Ungara and Ungar&#257;la, meaning rings, have
been recorded as exogamous septs of Balija and Kuruba.</p>
<p><b>Unittiri.</b>&mdash;Unittiri, or Uny&#257;tiri, meaning, it is
said, venerable boy, has been recorded as a sub-division of
S&#257;mantam. Unnitt&#257;n appears, in the Travancore Census Report,
1901, as a title of N&#257;yars, and is said to be derived from unni,
small, t&#257;n, a title of dignity.</p>
<p><b>Unnekankana.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Kurubas, who tie a
woollen thread (unne kankana) round the wrist at times of marriage.</p>
<p><b>Unni.</b>&mdash;For the following note on the Unnis of
Travancore, I am indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. The word Unni,
whatever its significance may have been of old, at present forms the
common title of four castes of the Ambalav&#257;si group, whose manners
and custom differ considerably in their details. They are known,
respectively, as Pushpakans, Br&#257;hmanis, Tiyattunnis, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>and
Nattu Pattars, their social precedence being in this order. Pushpakan
comes from pushpa, which in Sanskrit means either a flower or menses.
Br&#257;hmanis, more vulgarly known as Pappinis, are so named because
they perform some of the priestly functions of the Br&#257;hmans for
the S&#363;dra population of Travancore. T&#299;yattunnis, also known
as Taiyampatis in British Malabar, are so called from the peculiar
religious service they perform in some Hindu temples. Nattu Pattars are
also known as Pattar Unnis and Karappuram Unnis. Unni means a child,
and is used as an honorific term to denote the male children of a
Namb&#363;tiri&rsquo;s household. The reason why these Ambalav&#257;si
castes came to be so called was that they were looked upon as more
respectable than the N&#257;yars, by whom the term must doubtless have
been made use of at first. The Pushpakans are said to be divided into
three classes, namely Pushpakans, Nambiassans, and Puppallis. The first
section live only as far south as Ev&#363;r in Central Travancore, and
are called Nambiyars in the north. The Nambiyassans live in Cochin and
North Travancore, while the Puppallis are found only towards the south.
There are no sub-divisions among the Br&#257;hmanis and
Karappuramunnis. But the T&#299;yattunnis are divided into two classes,
namely the T&#299;yatinambiyans of the north, who are generally
employed in the temples of Sastha, and T&#299;yattunnis proper, who
perform a similar function in the shrines of Bhadrak&#257;li. Women are
also known as Atovarammamar and K&#333;villammamar.</p>
<p>Pushpakans are said to have arisen out of the union of a
Br&#257;hman woman in her menses with her husband. Parasur&#257;ma set
them apart, and gave them the occupation of making garlands in the
temples of Malabar. Though this derivation is given in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>K&#275;ralamahatmya, it may be more easily
believed that Pushpakan is derived from the occupation of working in
flowers. Puppalli, at any rate, is thus derived, and, as Palli
signifies anything sacred, the caste name arose from the occupation of
preparing garlands for deities. Nambiyassans, called also Nambiyars and
Nambis, must have been, as also the Puppallis and Br&#257;hmanis, one
with the Pushpakans. In some places, Nambiyassans are known to have
kept gymnasia and military training schools. The Br&#257;hmanis must
have undergone some degree of degradation because of the religious
songs which they sang during the marriages of the N&#257;yars, while
those who did not take part therein became, as it were, a separate
sept. Another tradition, accounting for the origin of the caste, is
that, as in primitive ages early marriages prevailed among the
Malay&#257;la Br&#257;hmans, the family of the Namb&#363;tiri who first
married his daughter after puberty was excommunicated, and gave origin
to the Pushpakas. This is untrue, as, in V&#275;dic times, adult
marriage was the rule, and the Namb&#363;tiris in this respect have
been known to follow a more primitive custom than the Br&#257;hmans of
the east coast. The T&#299;yattunnis are said to be the descendants of
a Bh&#363;ta or demon directed by Siva to sing songs in praise of
Bhadrak&#257;li, and appease her anger after the murder of Darika. They
must from the first have formed a distinct section of the
Ambalav&#257;sis. The Karappuram Unnis are supposed to have been
elevated to their present status by Cheraman Perum&#257;l, one of the
rulers of ancient K&#275;rala, as, though belonging to the S&#363;dra
caste, they were obliged on one occasion to perform Br&#257;hmanical
service for him. Perum&#257;l is believed to have permitted them to
take the title of Unni, and call themselves Pattar, by which name
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>East Coast Br&#257;hmans are known in Malabar.
Thus they came to own the three names Nattu Pattar, Pattar Unni, and
Karappuram Unni, Karappuram or Shertallay being the territory where the
sept received the above-mentioned social elevation from their
sovereign. Even now, many of them reside in the t&#257;luks of
Ambalapuzha and Shertallay.</p>
<p>The house of a Pushpaka is variously known as pushpakam, pumatum, or
padodakam, the last signifying a place where the water falls from the
feet of the deity, on account of its close proximity to the temple,
where the daily avocation of the Pushpaka lies. The houses of the
T&#299;yattunnis and Nattu Pattars are only known by the name of
bhavanam. As in the case of the Br&#257;hmans, the Pushpanis and
Br&#257;hmanis cover their bodies with a piece of cloth, carry an
umbrella, and are accompanied by N&#257;yar servant-maids when they go
out in public. The women have one more fold in their dress than the
Namb&#363;tiris. The neck ornament of women is the
cherut&#257;li-kuttam, and the ear ornament the katila. Bell-metal
bangles are worn round the wrists. Female T&#299;yattunnis and Nattu
Pattars do not wear the last, and are generally unaccompanied by
N&#257;yar servant-maids when they go out.</p>
<p>Pushpakans are believed to be the most fitting caste for the
preparation of flower garlands to be used in temples. They also assist
in the preparation of the materials for the daily offering.
Nambiyassans were instructors in arms in days of old, and kalari or
gymnasia are owned by them even at the present day. Their punyaha, or
purificatory ceremony after pollution, is performed by Pushpakans.
Br&#257;hmani women sing religious songs on the occasion of marriage
among all castes from Kshatriyas to N&#257;yars. In Kumaranall&#363;r
and other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>Bhagavati shrines, women are employed to sing
propitiatory songs, while the men make garlands, sweep the floor of the
inner court-yard and plinth, clean the temple vessels, and carry the
lamp when images are taken round in procession. It is only the first of
these temple services that the Pushpakas do, and their women never go
out to sing on marriage occasions. The word T&#299;yattu or Teyyatu is
said to be a corruption of Daivamattu, or dancing to please the deity.
According to one tradition, they were degraded from Pushpakas for
undertaking service in the temples. In more orthodox times,
t&#299;yattu could be performed only in temples and Br&#257;hman
houses, but now S&#363;dras also share the privilege of inviting the
T&#299;yattunnis to their homes for this purpose, though the ceremony
cannot be performed in their houses without a previous punyaha. The
rite is extremely popular when epidemic disease prevails. Ganapati and
Bhadrak&#257;li are, as a preliminary measure, worshipped, to the
accompaniment of musical instruments. As this has to be done in the
noon, it is called uchchappattu, or noon-day song. In the evening, an
image of Bhadrak&#257;li is drawn on the ground with powders of five
colours, white, yellow, black, green and red. At night, songs are sung
in praise of that deity by the T&#299;yattunni and his followers. A
member of the troupe then plays the part of Bhadrak&#257;li in the act
of murdering the demon Darika, and, in conclusion, waves a torch before
the inmates of the house, to ward off the evil eye, which is the most
important item in the whole ceremony. The torch is believed to be given
by Siva, who is worshipped before the light is waved.</p>
<p>The Karappuram Unnis, unlike the other septs of their class, are
mostly agriculturists. The Unnis are all Smartas, but a partiality for
Bhadrak&#257;li is manifested by the T&#299;yattunnis and
Br&#257;hmanis. All social matters <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226"
href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>among the Unnis are
superintended by Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hmans, but, in all that
directly touches the social well-being, their own headmen are the
judges. Before entering a Pushpaka&rsquo;s house for the observation of
any ceremony, the Namb&#363;tiris insist upon the performance of
punyaha. Though the superiority of Ilayatus is acknowledged, they are
never employed by the Pushpakas for priestly functions. The Ilayatus
are believed to have once been the priests of the Nattu Pattars, though
at the present time learned men from their own sept are employed for
this purpose. The punyaha is, however, performed through the agency of
Namb&#363;tiris. The priests of the Nambiyassans, T&#299;yattunnis, and
Br&#257;hmanis are Ilayatus.</p>
<p>Adult marriage prevails, twelve being the earliest age of a girl
when she ceases to be single. On the evening of the day before the
wedding, the bride has a ceremonial bath, and performs the ceremony of
growing a jasmine shoot, the flowers of which she should cull and
present as an offering to the deity. On the marriage day, the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party arrives in procession at the house of the
bride, who awaits them with her face covered, and holding a brass
mirror and garland of flowers in her hands. Her veil is removed, and
the contracting couple gaze at each other. At the auspicious hour their
hands are joined, and other items of the marriage rites carried out. In
connection with a Pushpaka marriage, ammana &#257;ttam or tossing of
metal balls, kaikottikali or the circular dance, and y&#257;trakali are
among the amusements indulged in. Divorce was common among the
Pushpakas in bygone days, but, at the present time, the marriage tie is
usually permanent, and it is only after the first husband&rsquo;s death
that cloths may be received from a Malay&#257;la Br&#257;hman in token
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>sambandham (alliance). The Br&#257;hmanis,
however, have not given up the practice of divorce. Nambiyassans,
Puppallis, Pattar Unnis, and Br&#257;hmanis follow the
marumakkatt&#257;yam system of inheritance (through the female line),
while the Pushpakas and T&#299;yattunnis are makkatt&#257;yis, and
follow the law of inheritance from father to son. The offspring of a
Br&#257;hmani by a Pushpaka woman are regarded as issue in a
makkatt&#257;yam family. As is the custom among the Namb&#363;tiris,
only the eldest son marries, the other sons remaining as sn&#257;takas,
and contracting alliances with N&#257;yar women. The Illam N&#257;yars,
however, do not give their daughters to the Unnis.</p>
<p>The jatakarma, though not strictly proper, is observed in modern
days. The namakarana takes place, along with the annaprasana, in the
sixth month after birth. The chaula is performed in the third year,
though, among the Nattu Pattars, it is a preliminary ceremony before
upanayana. The proper time for the performance of the upanayana is
between the eighth and sixteenth year. Sam&#257;vartana takes place on
the fourteenth day after upanayana. Pollution lasts for only ten days
among the T&#299;yattunnis, whereas the Br&#257;hmanis observe twelve,
and the Nattu Pattars thirteen days&rsquo; pollution. Ten gayatris
(hymns) are allowed to be recited thrice daily.</p>
<p>The Pushpakas are the highest of the thread-wearing sections of the
Ambalav&#257;sis, according to their traditional origin as well as
their religious and social practices. The Pattar Unnis are the lowest,
and are only a step higher than the Kurukkals. Consecrated water and
flowers are not given to them directly by the temple priest, but they
may stand on the right side of the stone steps leading to the inner
shrine. This is the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228"
name="pb228">228</a>]</span>rule with all Ambalav&#257;si divisions.
Other Ambalav&#257;sis do not receive food from the Unnis. These
sections of the Unnis which have Ilayatus for their priests accept food
from them. As the Pushpakas proper employ only Namb&#363;tiris for
purificatory purposes, the latter freely cook food in their houses, as
in those of the M&#363;ttatus.</p>
<p>It is recorded by Mr. Logan<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3837src"
href="#xd21e3837" name="xd21e3837src">6</a> that the T&#299;yattunnis
or T&#299;y&#257;dis (ti, fire; &#257;ttam, play) are &ldquo;a class of
pseudo-Br&#257;hmans in Malabar, who derive their name from the
ceremony of jumping through fire before temples.&rdquo; Mr. Subramani
Aiyar writes, in this connection, that &ldquo;I do not think Mr. Logan
is quite right when he describes the service of the T&#299;yattunnis as
jumping through fire. It is dancing with lighted wicks in the hands, to
exorcise the genius representing the evil eye, or as a propitiatory
service in temples. It answers to the pallippanna and kolantullal of
the Kaniyans. A figure of Bhadrak&#257;li is drawn on the ground with
powders of different colours, and the chief incidents in the incarnate
life of the deity are recited by the T&#299;yattunnis. After this, some
cocoanuts are broken in two, and lighted wicks are then placed before
the presiding deity if done in a temple as a propitiatory service, or
before any particular individual or individuals, if the object is to
free him or them from the effect of the evil eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Uppalavar</b> (salt workers).&mdash;A synonym of Alavan.</p>
<p><b>Uppara.</b>&mdash;For the following note, I am mainly indebted to
Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. Uppiliyan, Uppara, Upp&#257;ra or Uppaliga, are
different names for a class of people, who followed the same
professional <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>occupation, the manufacture of salt (uppu), in
various parts of Southern India. The Uppiliyans live in the Tamil
country, and speak Tamil; the Upparas in the Telugu country, and speak
Telugu; while the Upp&#257;ras inhabit the Mysore province and the
districts bordering thereon, and speak Canarese. The Upparas are
described by Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3850src" href=
"#xd21e3850" name="xd21e3850src">7</a> as &ldquo;a caste of
tank-diggers and earth-workers, corresponding to the Uppiliyans of the
Tamil districts. They resemble greatly the Oddes (Voddas or Wudders) in
appearance, customs, and manner of earning a living. Their traditional
occupation is, as the name implies, manufacturing earth-salt. They
profess to be Saivites and Vaishnavites, but practically worship
village deities, <i>e.g.</i>, Sunkalamma, Timmappa, and
Jambulamma.&rdquo; It is possible that the Uppiliyans, Upparas, and
Upp&#257;ras were originally a homogeneous caste, the members of which,
in course of time, migrated to different parts of the country, and
adopted the language of the locality in which they settled. The causes,
which may have led to the breaking up of the caste, are not far to
seek. The original occupation thereof, according to the legendary story
of its origin, was tank, channel, and well digging. Southern India
depended in days gone by, as at the present time, mainly on its
agricultural produce, and people were required, then as now, to secure,
conserve, and distribute the water, which was essential for
agricultural prosperity. Inscriptions, such as those quoted by Mr. V.
Venkayya,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3856src" href="#xd21e3856" name=
"xd21e3856src">8</a> bear testimony to the energy displayed by former
rulers in Southern India in having tanks, wells, and irrigation
channels constructed. Uppiliyans, Upparas or Upp&#257;ras, are, at the
present day, found all over the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>Madras Presidency, from
Ganjam in the north to Tinnevelley in the south. From early times they
seem to have, in addition to the work already indicated, been engaged
in bricklaying, house-building, the construction of forts, and every
kind of earth-work.</p>
<p>Writing concerning the Telugu Upparas at the beginning of the
nineteenth century, Buchanan states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3866src"
href="#xd21e3866" name="xd21e3866src">9</a> that &ldquo;their proper
occupation is the building of mud walls, especially those of
forts.&rdquo; A very important occupation of these people was the
manufacture of earth-salt and saltpetre, of which the latter was an
important ingredient in the manufacture of gunpowder. &ldquo;Throughout
India,&rdquo; Dr. G. Oppert writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3869src"
href="#xd21e3869" name="xd21e3869src">10</a> &ldquo;saltpetre is found,
and the Hindus are well acquainted with all its properties; it is even
commonly prescribed as a medicine. India was famous for the exportation
of saltpetre, and is so. The Dutch, when in India, traded especially in
this article.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Uppiliyans say that they are descended from a man who was
created to provide salt for the table of their god, but lost the favour
of the deity because his wife bartered the salt for some glass bangles.
In his wrath he put his wife into the oven to kill her, but she escaped
through a hole in the back. As evidence of the truth of the story, they
point to the facts that their women wear no glass bangles, and that
their ovens always have a hole in them. The caste further traces its
descent from a mythical individual, named Sagara, to whom is ascribed
the digging of the Bay of Bengal. His story is narrated in the Vishnu
Pur&#257;na,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3874src" href="#xd21e3874"
name="xd21e3874src">11</a> and is briefly as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>follows. Sagara was son of B&#257;hu, who was
overrun by the Haihayas and T&#257;lajanghas, and consequently retired
to the forest, where, near the hermitage of Muni Aurva, one of his
queens conceived. A rival queen poisoned her, so as to prevent her from
being delivered of the child. Meanwhile, B&#257;hu waxed old, and his
pregnant wife prepared to ascend the funeral pyre with him. But the
Muni forbade her, saying that she was going to be the mother of an
universal emperor. She accordingly desisted from the desperate act, and
a splendid boy was born, and the poison expelled along with him. The
Muni, on this account, gave him the name of Sagara, meaning with
poison. As he grew up, the boy came to know of the troubles of his
father, and resolved to recover his kingdom. He put to death nearly the
whole of the Haihayas, and made the others acknowledge his suzerainty.
He had two wives, by one of whom he had a son named Asamanja, and by
the other sixty thousand sons. He subsequently performed the
asvam&#275;dha or sacrifice of a horse, which was guarded by his sons.
The animal was, however, carried off by some one into a chasm in the
earth. Sagara commanded his sons to search for the steed, and they
traced him by the impressions of the hoofs to the chasm, which he had
entered. They proceeded to enlarge it, and dug downwards, each for a
league. Coming to P&#257;t&#257;l&#257;, they saw the horse wandering
freely about, and at no great distance from it was Kapila Rishi,
sitting in meditation. Exclaiming &ldquo;This is the villain who has
maliciously interrupted our sacrifice, and stolen the horse, kill him,
kill him,&rdquo; they ran towards him with uplifted weapons. The Rishi
raised his eyes, and for an instant looked upon them, and they became
reduced to ashes by the sacred flame that darted from him. On learning
of the death of his sons, Sagara <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232"
href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>sent Amsumat, the son of
Asamanja, to secure the animal. He went by the deep path which his
father and uncles had dug, and, arriving at the place where Kapila was,
propitiated him with an obeisance. The Rishi gave him the horse, to be
delivered to his father, and in conferring the boon which Amsumat
prayed for, said that his grandson would bring down the divine Ganges,
whose &ldquo;waters shall wash the bones and ashes of thy
grandfather&rsquo;s sons,&rdquo; and raise them to swarga. Sagara then
completed his sacrifice, and, in affectionate memory of his sons,
called the chasm which they had dug Sagara. This is still the name of
the ocean, and especially of the Bay of Bengal at the mouth of the
Ganges, which, in accordance with the boon of Kapila, was brought down
to earth by Amsumat&rsquo;s grandson Bhagiratha, from whom it received
the name of Bh&#257;girathi, which it retains to this day. Such is the
story of the origin of the caste, members of which often call it Sagara
kula, or the family of Sagara. As his sons excavated the ocean, so they
dig tanks, channels, wells, etc. In the Mysore Census Reports, the
Upparas are said to be called &ldquo;Uppara in the eastern, Uppaliga in
the southern, and M&#275;lu (west) Sakkre in the western districts.
[Some explain that they work in salt, which is more essential than
sugar, and that M&#275;l Sakkare means superior sugar.] This caste is
divided into the Telugu and Karnataka sub-divisions. The latter make
earth-salt, while the former work as bricklayers and builders. The
well-to-do section of the caste further undertake public works on
contract, and some of them are good architects of ordinary Hindu
houses, which do not call for much scientific precision. There are also
agriculturists and labourers among them.&rdquo; In the Madras
Presidency, at the present day, some members of the caste are well and
tank diggers, house-builders or bricklayers; others are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>agricultural labourers, or village servants. A
few are earth-work contractors, or, as at Muthialpet near Conjeeveram,
yarn dyers. Some are in the service of Government as police constables.
The women are very hard-working, and help their husbands at their work.
To this fact is said to be due the high rate at which the bride-price
is fixed. The well-kept roads of the city of Madras are the work of a
colony of Upparas, who have settled there. The following curious custom
is recorded by the Rev. J. Cain in a note<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3885src" href="#xd21e3885" name="xd21e3885src">12</a> on the
tank-diggers of the God&#257;vari district. &ldquo;A disturbance in a
little camp of tank-diggers confirmed a statement which I heard at
Masulipatam as to the manner in which the tank-diggers divide their
wages. They had been repairing the bank of a tank, and been paid for
their work, and, in apportioning the shares of each labourer, a bitter
dispute arose because one of the women had not received what she deemed
her fair amount. On enquiry, it turned out that she was in an
interesting condition, and therefore could claim not only her own, but
also a share for the expected child. This had been overlooked, and,
when she asserted her right to a double portion, those who had already
received their money objected to part with any, although they
acknowledged that the claim was fair and just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the Madras Salt Act, 1889, it is enacted that any person
who&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) removes any salt without or in excess of the permits
necessary by this Act; or</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) except for agricultural or building purposes, excavates,
collects or possesses salt-earth in any local area where it is
contraband salt; or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234"
name="pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) manufactures contraband salt in any other way than by
excavating or collecting salt-earth; or</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) purchases, obtains, possesses, sells or weighs contraband
salt other than salt-earth, knowing or having reason to believe it to
be contraband; or</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) refines saltpetre without such license as is prescribed
by the Act; or</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) attempts to commit, or within the meaning of the Indian
Penal Code abets the commission of any of the above acts,</p>
<p>shall on conviction be punishable for every such offence with
imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or with fine not
exceeding five hundred rupees, or with both.</p>
<p>It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the Bellary district, that
&ldquo;at the time when the Company came into possession of the
district, the salt consumed in it was of two kinds, namely, the
earth-salt manufactured from saline soils by men of the Uppara caste,
and the marine salt made on the west coast. The latter was imported by
the Lamb&#257;dis and Korachas, who brought it up the gh&#257;ts by
means of large droves of pack-bullocks. The earth-salt was made in what
were known as modas, which were peculiar to the Ceded Districts, and
were especially common in Bellary. A heap of earth was piled up, and on
the top of it were hollowed out one or more circular basins, some five
feet in diameter and two feet deep. From the bottom of these basins,
channels lined with chunam (lime) ran down to one or more reservoirs
similarly lined. Salt-earth was collected in the places where it
effloresced naturally in the dry months, and taken to the moda on
pack-buffaloes. It was thrown into the basins, and then a quantity of
water was poured upon it. The brine so obtained flowed through the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>channels at the bottom of the basins into the
reservoirs. From these it was baled with chatties (pots) into a set of
masonry evaporating pans, carefully levelled and plastered with chunam,
where it was left to be converted into salt by solar evaporation. Each
lot of salt-earth, which was thus lixiviated, was taken from the basins
and thrown outside them, and this process constantly repeated gradually
raised the level of the moda and the basins, which were perpetually
being re-made on the top of it. Some of the modas gradually grew to be
as much as twenty feet in height. When they became too high for the
buffaloes to carry the salt-earth up to their summits with comfort,
they were abandoned, and others started elsewhere. The earth-salt made
in this manner was neither so good nor so strong as marine salt, but it
was much used by the poorer classes and for cattle, and thus interfered
with the profits of the Government salt monopoly, which was established
in 1805. As early as 1806, therefore, it was proposed to prohibit its
manufacture. The chief arguments against any such step were that it
would inflict hardship upon the Upparas who made the salt, and upon the
poorer classes who consumed it, and, for the next three quarters of a
century, a wearisome correspondence dragged on regarding the course
which it would be proper to pursue. In 1873, Mr. G. Thornhill, Member
of the Board of Revenue, visited the Ceded Districts, to see how
matters stood. He reported that it was not possible to check the
competition of the earth-salt with the Government marine salt by
imposing an excise duty, as the modas were numerous and scattered. For
similar reasons, and also because all the Upparas were very poor, a
license-tax was out of the question. At the same time he calculated
that the loss to Government due to the system was from eight to ten
lakhs annually, and, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236"
name="pb236">236</a>]</span>seeing that Government salt was obtainable
in Bellary as cheaply as in other inland districts, he recommended that
the industry should be gradually suppressed. Government agreed, and
ordered that the opening of new modas should be prohibited, and that
those in existence should be licensed, with reference to their
productive capacity, at rates to increase by annual increments until
1879, when the full duty leviable on sea-salt should be imposed on
their entire produce. These measures, though they checked the
manufacture, failed to entirely protect the revenue, and, in 1876, the
Madras Salt Commission and Board of Revenue concurred in recommending
that the manufacture of earth-salt should be at once and entirely
suppressed. The Government of India agreed, and in 1880 orders were
given that the modas should all be destroyed, reasonable compensation
being paid to their owners. The manufacture of earth-salt in the
district is now entirely a thing of the past, though in many places the
remains of the old modas may still be seen. Some of the Upparas,
however, still go annually to the Nizam&rsquo;s Dominions in the dry
season, and make earth-salt by the old methods for sale there.
Apparently they agree with the Nizam&rsquo;s Government to pay a
certain fee, one-fourth of which is paid in advance, for the privilege.
If the season is sufficiently dry, they make a small profit, but if, on
the other hand, it is wet, manufacture is impossible, and they lose the
amount of the fee, and their labour as well.&rdquo; A good deal of
saltpetre is still made by members of the caste in various parts of the
Madras Presidency by lixiviating the alkaline efflorescence of the
earth. For this purpose, licenses are obtained annually from the Salt
Department. Crude saltpetre is sold for manure on coffee estates, and
also used in the manufacture of fireworks. <span class=

<p>Speaking different languages, and living in different parts of the
country, the Uppiliyans, Upparas, and Upp&#257;ras do not intermarry,
though, where they are found close together, they interdine.</p>
<p>The caste recognises the authority of its headmen, who are called
Periyathanak&#257;ran, Ejam&#257;n, etc., and are assisted in some
places, for example Madras, by a J&#257;tibidda (son of the caste), who
does the duties of caste peon or messenger, summoning members to a
caste council-meeting, and so on. The usual punishments inflicted by a
caste council are excommunication, fine, and the giving of a caste
dinner. I am informed that, among the Canarese Upp&#257;ras, a woman
found guilty of adultery is punished as follows. A lock of her hair is
cut off, and she is bathed in cold water, and made to drink a little
cow-dung water. She is then taken to the temple, where the
p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest) sprinkles holy water over her head. A fine is
paid by her family. A man, who is proved guilty of a similar offence,
has one side of his moustache and one of his eyebrows shaved off, and
the hair of his head is removed in three parallel lines. Seven small
booths are constructed of straw, and set on fire. Through this the man
has to pass. He is then plunged into a tank, and, after bathing
therein, he is sprinkled with holy water. I am told that a woman has
also to go through the fire ordeal.</p>
<p>Girls are married either before or after puberty, but usually after.
Among the Uppiliyans and Upparas, it is customary for a man to claim
his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter in marriage. The ceremonies in
connection with marriage vary in accordance with the locality. Amongst
the Uppiliyans of Madura, the t&#257;li (marriage badge) is usually
tied to the bride&rsquo;s neck by a special woman, resident in her
village, called S&#299;rk&#257;ri. In some places it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>is
tied, as among some other Tamil castes, by the bridegroom&rsquo;s
sister. Among the Telugu and Canarese sections, it is tied by the
bridegroom himself. By the Upp&#257;ras of South Canara, the dh&#257;re
marriage rite is performed, in which the father of the bride pours
water from a vessel over the united hands of the contracting couple. I
am told that, among some Canarese Upp&#257;ras, the bridegroom&rsquo;s
head is shaved, and, after bathing, he puts on a double brass wire
corresponding to the sacred thread of the Br&#257;hmans, which he wears
for five days. Among the Telugu Upparas there are two sub-divisions,
which are called, according to the amount of the bride-price, Y&#275;du
(seven) M&#257;dala and Padah&#257;ru (sixteen) M&#257;dala, a
m&#257;da being equal to two rupees. Some say that m&#257;da refers to
the modas (heaps of earth) used in former times. At a marriage among
some Uppiliyans, it is customary for the bride and bridegroom to sit
inside a wall made of piled up water pots, with the ends of their
cloths tied together, while some of the women present pour water from
the pots over their heads. The remarriage of widows is permitted, and I
gather that, among the Upp&#257;ras, a widow may only marry a widower,
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>
<p>In a note on the Uppiliyans of the Trichinopoly district, Mr. F. R.
Hemingway states that &ldquo;some of the marriage ceremonies are
peculiar. They allow an unborn boy to be betrothed to his unborn
cousin. The bride has to be asked in marriage a number of times, before
consent is given, lest it be thought that she is yielding too easily.
The marriage is performed at her house, lest it should be thought that
her parents are forcing her on the bridegroom. The caste does not use
the marriage pole or p&#257;ligai pots. Instead of the usual turmeric
threads, the wrists of the contracting couple are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>tied
together with wool. A curious custom among the Tamil section is that,
at the beginning of the ceremonies, both on the first and second day,
three matrons wash their faces in turmeric water, and the bride and
bridegroom are bathed with the water used by them. They also have
unusual observances connected with a girl&rsquo;s attainment of
maturity. A husband may not look into his bride&rsquo;s eyes until this
occurs. When she has at length attained maturity, the husband comes to
his bride&rsquo;s house with a sheep and some vegetables, and kills the
former. His brother-in-law then marks his forehead with the
sheep&rsquo;s blood. The husband eats some plantain and milk, and spits
it out at his bride, who is made to stand behind a screen. If the girl
has attained maturity before her marriage, the Tamil section of the
caste make her walk over seven wooden hoops on the wedding day. The
husband has to give his formal consent to the ceremony, and a washerman
has to be present. The Telugus perform this rite on the last day of the
girl&rsquo;s first menstrual period, and her maternal uncle has to be
present. The Uppiliyans allow the remarriage of widows and divorced
women. A man may not shave until he marries a virgin, and, if he does
not do so, he has to remain unshaved all his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dead are, as a rule, buried. Among the Uppiliyans, who occupy a
higher social position than the Canarese and Telugu sections, death
pollution is observed for seven days. Among the Upp&#257;ras, the
period of pollution is sixteen days.</p>
<p>Concerning the death ceremonies, Mr. Hemingway writes as follows.
&ldquo;Widows of the Tamil section never remove their t&#257;li, but
leave it till it drops off of itself. When a man dies, his widow is
made to pretend he is still alive, and bathes him with oil, and puts
garlands on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>him. If a man is to be buried, the chief mourner
pretends to dig the grave. The karum&#257;ntaram, or final death
ceremony, of the Tamil section consists merely in taking some milk to
an erukka (<i lang="la-x-bio">Calotropis gigantea</i>) shrub on the
sixteenth evening, just before the jackals begin to howl. They pour it
over the shrub with the help of a barber, saying &lsquo;Go to Swarga
(the abode of Indra), and make your way to Kail&#257;sam
(heaven).&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some members of the caste are Vaishnavites, and others Saivites. In
some places, the former are branded by their gurus, who are Vaishnava
Br&#257;hmans. They also worship various village deities, which vary
according to the place of residence. In the Census Report, 1891, the
worship of Sunkalamma, Jambulamma, and Timmappa is noted.</p>
<p>It is stated by Mr. Hemingway that &ldquo;the Uppiliyans have a
caste god, named Karuvandar&#257;ya Bommad&#275;va. He has no temple,
but all the Uppiliyans in a village join in offering him an annual
sacrifice in Tai (January-February), before the earth is scraped for
the first time in the season for making saltpetre. They use &#257;varam
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Cassia auriculata</i>) flowers and river sand in
this worship. They also have three special caste goddesses, called
T&#299;ppanj&#257;l, who are supposed to be women who committed sati.
They have also Br&#257;hman gurus, who visit them every year, and bless
their salt pits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the caste organisation of the Uppiliyans, Mr. Hemingway
writes that &ldquo;when a complaint of a caste offence is made, notice
is sent to the Pattakk&#257;ran (headman), and to the whole Uppiliyan
community in the neighbourhood, notifying the accusation and the
provisional expulsion of the accused. A second notice summons the
community to a panch&#257;yat (council), which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>is
presided over by at least two or three Pattakk&#257;rans, the caste god
being represented by some &#257;varam flowers, a pot of water, and
margosa (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves. If
acquitted, the accused is made to touch the water pot in token of his
innocence. If he is convicted, both he and the complainant are fined,
the latter for the purification of his house, if it has been polluted
by the offence. The purification is performed by a man of the
Marud&#363;r N&#257;du called Rettai Vilakkuk&#257;ran (man of two
lights), who eats a meal in the polluted house, with his hands held
behind his back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was recently noted that the Upp&#257;ras are, as a rule,
uneducated, and their ignorance of the three R&rsquo;s often leads to
bitter disputes among themselves and with their employers in disbursing
their wages. Some years ago, one of the Madras Missions opened a school
for the benefit of this backward caste. In 1906, the Hindu Educational
Mission of Madras started a night and day school, Upparap&#257;laiyam
&#256;rya P&#257;thas&#257;la, in the Upparap&#257;laiyam quarter of
Madras.</p>
<p>There is a Telugu proverb to the effect that one is ruined both
ways, like an Upp&#257;ra who has turned Sany&#257;si (ascetic), in
reference to the fact that he neither follows his ancestral occupation,
nor is tolerated in his new calling. The usual caste title is
Chetti.</p>
<p>Upp&#257;ra occurs as a synonym of K&#363;sa Holeya.</p>
<p><b>Uppu</b> (salt).&mdash;A sub-division of Balijas and Koravas, who
trade in salt, which they carry about the country in panniers on
donkeys or bullocks. It is also an occupational sub-division of
K&#333;mati. The equivalent Uppa is an exogamous sept of K&#275;lasi.
Uppuk&#333;ttei occurs as a division of Maravan, Upputholuv&#257;ru
(salt-carriers) as an exogamous sept of Odd&#275;, and Uppiri
(salt-earth) as a sept of Kuruba. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242"
href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>Ur&#257;li.</b>&mdash;In the Madras Census Report, 1891, the
Ur&#257;lis are described as &ldquo;a caste of agricultural labourers
found chiefly in the districts of Madura and Trichinopoly. The word
Ur&#257;li means a ruler of a village. Like the Ambalakk&#257;rans,
they trace their descent from one Muttur&#257;ja, and the only
sub-division returned by any number is Mutr&#257;cha. They also assert
that they were formerly employed as soldiers. In the Wyn&#257;d there
is a section of Kurumbas called Ur&#257;li Kurumbas, and it is not
improbable that these Ur&#257;lis of the Tamil country are an offshoot
of the great Kurumba race.&rdquo; The Ur&#257;lis are further summed up
in the same report, as &ldquo;agricultural labourers in Coimbatore,
Trichinopoly, and Madura. There seems to be some connection between the
Ur&#257;lis and the Ambalakk&#257;rans or Muttiriyans. Muttiriyan is a
sub-division of both Ur&#257;li and Ambalakk&#257;ran, and both of
these are found in the same districts. Perhaps the Ur&#257;lis are an
offshoot of the Tamil Valaiyans, which by change of occupation has
transformed itself into a distinct caste (<i>see</i>
Ambalakk&#257;ran). The caste is split up into a number of
sub-divisions, called after the name of the tract or n&#257;du in
Trichinopoly which each inhabits. To get back into the caste, an
excommunicated man has to kill a sheep or goat before the elders, and
mark his forehead with the blood. He then gives a feast to the
assembly, and puts part of the food on the roof of his house. If the
crows eat this, he is received back into the caste. [Br&#257;hmans
always put out portions of the sr&#257;ddha offerings in the same way,
and judge whether they are acceptable or not by noting if the crows eat
them or not.] Marriage is infant or adult. A man detected in an
intrigue with an unmarried woman is fined, and has to marry her, and at
the wedding his waist string is tied round her neck instead of a
t&#257;li. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>well-to-do people of the caste employ
Br&#257;hmans as priests, but others content themselves with their own
elders. Widows and divorced women may marry again. The dead are either
burned or buried. The richer members of the caste perform sr&#257;ddha
(memorial service for the dead). They drink alcohol, and eat fowls,
mutton, pork, fish, rats, etc. In social position they come below the
Idaiyans, Tottiyans, and Kallans. Their title is Kavandan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following note on the Ur&#257;lis of the Trichinopoly
district, I am indebted to Mr. F. R. Hemingway. &ldquo;They say that
they were originally Kshatriyas living in &lsquo;Alipuram near
Oudh,&rsquo; and left that place in search of adventure, or in
consequence of disputes at home, leaving their wives behind them, and
finally settled in the south, where they married serving women
(pulukkachis). They say that they belong to the Muttur&#257;ja Kuttam,
a phrase they cannot explain, and protest that the Ambalakk&#257;rans,
who make a similar claim, have no ground for so doing. They seem to eat
with no other caste on equal terms, but will, of course, accept
separate meals from Vell&#257;lans. They are split into seven
n&#257;dus, which are in effect endogamous sub-divisions. These are
called after villages in the country inhabited by the caste, namely,
Vadas&#275;ri, Pill&#363;ru, S&#275;ngudi, Kadavangudi or Vir&#257;li,
Talakka, Paluvinji or Magali, and Marungi. The members of the first
three of these n&#257;dus are called Vadas&#275;ri Ur&#257;lis, and
those of the other four N&#257;ttu-s&#299;mai Ur&#257;lis,
Kunduva-n&#257;ttu-tokk&#257;dus, or Nandutindis. All of them will mess
together. They say that the n&#257;dus were originally intended to
facilitate the decision of caste disputes, and they are still the unit
of self-government. Each n&#257;du has a headman, who exercises supreme
control over the villages included <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244"
href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>within it. The Ur&#257;lis
also have a number of exogamous septs called karais by the
Vadas&#275;ris and k&#257;niyacchis by the N&#257;ttu-s&#299;mais,
which are called after the names of places. They are generally
cultivators, but are said sometimes to be given to crime. They wear the
sacred thread on occasions of marriages and funerals. The women can be
recognised by their dress, the kusavam being spread out behind, and a
characteristic pencil-shaped ornament (kuchu) being suspended from the
neck. Some of their marriage and funeral customs are peculiar. Among
the N&#257;ttu-s&#299;mais, the betrothal is ratified by the maternal
uncle of each of the pair solemnly measuring out three measures of
paddy (rice) in the presence of the other party at their house. At
their funerals, the bier is not brought into the village, but left
outside, and the corpse is carried to it. Among the Vadas&#275;ris,
while preparations are being made for the removal of the body, a
Paraiyan woman performs a dance. Among the N&#257;ttu-s&#299;mais this
is done on the Ettu day. On the second day after the funeral, the
relatives of the deceased dip their toes in a mortar full of cow-dung
water placed in front of his house, and put sacred ashes on the head.
The karum&#257;ntaram, or final death ceremony, is only performed by
the rich. It can take place at any time after the third day. The Ettu
ceremony is similarly performed at any time after the third day, and is
attended with a curious ritual. Both sections of the caste erect a
booth, in which three plantain trees are planted, and the chief mourner
and his cousins stand there all day to receive the condolences of their
friends. From this point the practice of the two sections differs in
small points of detail. Among the Vadas&#275;ris, the friends come one
by one, and are asked by the chief mourner, &ldquo;Will you embrace, or
will you strike your forehead?&rdquo; In <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>reply, the friend
either closes the open hand of the chief mourner with his own as a form
of embrace, or flings himself on the ground in the booth, and weeps.
Each visitor then goes to a meeting of the n&#257;du which is being
held outside the village, and a Paraiyan and three Ur&#257;lis inform
the headman who have visited the booth and who have not, and ask if it
may be removed. Permission being given, the plantains are cut down, and
the woman-folk wail round a chembu (vessel) placed there. All then
proceed to the n&#257;du meeting, where a turban is put on a Paraiyan,
a dancing-girl and a Pand&#257;ram, and the Paraiyan (called N&#257;ttu
S&#257;mban) beats his drum, and pronounces a blessing on the
n&#257;du. Finally all repair to the house of the deceased, where the
headman puts three handfuls of kambu (millet) into the cloth of his
wife or some other member of the family, and throws a mortar on the
ground. Punishments for caste offences take some curious forms. A
margosa (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaf is put on the
house of anyone who is excommunicated. If a man seduces a girl of the
caste, an enquiry is held, and the pair are married. The waist-string
of the man is tied round the neck of the woman, and a Tottiyan is
called in to take away the pollution which they and their relatives
have incurred. They are taken to a tank (pond), where 108 holes have
been made by the Tottiyan, and are made to bathe in every hole,
sprinkling the water over their heads. A sheep is then killed by a
Tottiyan and a Chakkiliyan, its head is buried, and the couple and
their relatives are made to walk over the spot. The blood of the animal
is then smeared on their foreheads, and they all have to bathe again.
They are next given cow&rsquo;s urine to drink, and then once more
bathe. After that they are given milk, and are made to prostrate
themselves before the panch&#257;yat (council). Finally they have to
give a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>feast to the panch&#257;yat, at which a part of
the food is offered to the crows, and the purification is not complete
till the birds have partaken thereof. The Ur&#257;lis are fond of
shik&#257;r (hunting). On the Sivar&#257;tri night, sacrifices are
offered to their family gods, and, on the following day, all the men of
the village go out hunting. They have a head shik&#257;ri (huntsman),
called K&#257;v&#275;ttaik&#257;ran, who receives every animal which is
killed, cuts off its head, and breaks its legs. The head is given to
the man who killed the animal, and the rest is shared among the
castemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the Ur&#257;lis who inhabit the hill country of Travancore, the
following account is given in the Travancore Census report, 1901.
&ldquo;The Ur&#257;lis are a class of hill tribes resident in the
Cardamom Hills. They are chiefly found in the tracts known as
Kunnan&#257;t, Velampan, Kurakkan&#257;t, Mannuk&#257;t, Kalan&#257;t,
and Periy&#363;r. The headman of the Ur&#257;lis in each of these areas
is called a K&#257;nikk&#257;ran. Tradition tells us that they were the
dependents of the kings of Madura, and that their duty was to hold
umbrellas in times of State processions. In ancient times, many of the
parts now included in the Todupuzha t&#257;luk belonged to the kingdom
of Madura. Once, when the king came to N&#275;riyamangalam, the
ancestors of these Ur&#257;lis are said to have accompanied him, and to
have been left there to rule (&#257;li) that locally (&#363;r). The
males dress like the low-country people, with cloths about four cubits
long extending from the hip to the knee. Another cloth, about one or
two cubits in length, is put over the back, one end of which passes
under their right arm and the other over the shoulder, both meeting in
front over the chest, where they are tied together in a peculiar knot
by folding the extremities, thus forming a bag wherein to contain their
wayside necessaries. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247"
name="pb247">247</a>]</span>Females wear two pieces of cloth, nine and
two and a half cubits in length respectively, and folded in the middle.
The larger is the lower garment, and the smaller upper garment is worn
with two ends tied around the neck. Males wear brass finger and
toe-rings, sometimes of silver. Some adorn their necks with wreaths of
beads, from fifteen to thirty in number. Females wear ear-ornaments
known as k&#257;tumani, which are rings of metal wire, four or five in
number. Males generally allow their hair to grow, the face alone being
now and then shaven. The Ur&#257;lis eat rice for six months of the
year, and subsist on roots, fruits, and other forest produce during the
remaining half. A large portion of the paddy (rice) that the
Ur&#257;lis gather by cultivation goes to the low country in exchange
for clothing and salt. The flesh of most animals is eaten, but the
elephant and buffalo are held in such great respect that no Ur&#257;li
ever ventures to hurt them. Even the approach of the buffalo is
religiously avoided. They begin to fell forest trees in Dhanu
(December-January), and seeds are sown by the end of M&#275;tam
(April-May). They have only a katti, which is a kind of chopping knife,
for purposes of ploughing. After cultivation they change their abodes.
They put up huts in the vicinity of the cultivated areas, and use
bamboo and reeds as materials. After leaving the old, and before
putting up the new hut, they live for several days in caves or under
trees. They are very good watchmen, and take great care in putting up
fences, weeding, and protecting cultivation from wild animals. They
make excellent mats of reed. They are clever huntsmen, and are
passionately attached to their hunting dogs. They hoard their grains in
wicker baskets called virivallam. They possess copper and brass
vessels, mortar, chopping knives, sickles, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>spades, flint and steel. A man after marriage
lives with his wife, apart from his parents. Pollution of a very
aggravated kind is observed during the menstrual and puerperal periods.
On these occasions a separate m&#257;tam (hut), called the
p&#257;ttu-pandal, is put up at a distance from the dwelling hut. Here
the woman stays for three days. After bathing on the fourth day, she
shifts to another m&#257;tam still nearer, and stays there for one or
two days. On the seventh day she rejoins the family. In cases of
confinement, twelve days are spent in the remotest hut, and five days
in the nearer one. But for another period of twenty days the woman is
not permitted to touch any one in the house, or even the roofing of the
hut. During these days food is prepared by others, and given to her.
The water in which those who are confined, and those who are in their
menses bathe, is considered to be defiled beyond remedy. Hence, for
bathing purposes some secluded and out-of-the-way pool, called
p&#257;ttuvellam, is selected. Ur&#257;lis coming to the low country
hesitate to drink water, on the score that it might be thus polluted.
When the woman delivers herself of her first child, her husband
observes three days&rsquo; pollution, but none for subsequent
confinements. On all such occasions, the maternal relations of the
woman have to observe five days&rsquo; pollution. On the eighteenth day
after birth, the eldest member of the family names the child, and bores
the ear. The head of the child is shaved as soon as it is able to walk,
and a tuft of hair is left in front. The corpses of the Ur&#257;lis are
not burnt, but buried at a sufficient distance from the house. A new
cloth is put into the grave by each relative. After filling in the
grave, they erect a shed over it, within which the chopping knife of
the deceased, a quantity of boiled rice, and some chewing materials
(betel and nuts) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249"
name="pb249">249</a>]</span>are placed. After the lapse of seven years,
an offering of food and drink is made to the departed soul. Death
pollution lasts for sixteen days. The Ur&#257;lis address their father
as appan, and maternal uncle as achchan. Marumakkath&#257;yam is the
prevailing form of inheritance (in the female line). Marriage is
settled by the parents. There is no t&#257;li symbol to indicate the
wedded state. After the marriage is settled, the girl is merely sent to
the pandal or hut of the husband. The Ur&#257;lis intermarry with the
Ull&#257;dans, and in rare cases with Muduvans. Remarriage is
permitted. An Ur&#257;li, wishing to get married into a particular
family, has to wed into the family a girl belonging to his own. The
Ur&#257;lis have a fine ear for music, and sing many songs in the night
before going to bed. Like the K&#257;nis (K&#257;nikars), they resort
to enchantments called cheppuka and ch&#257;ttuka for the cure of
diseases. Their would-be sorcerers have to leave the community, and
wander alone in the forest for a number of months. They are said to
then get into a trance, when their forefathers appear before them as
maidens, and teach them the mystic arts. The Ur&#257;lis bear their
loads only on the back, and never on the head. They never go to distant
places without their chopping knife. They are good forest
guides.&rdquo; The Ur&#257;lis are stated by the Rev. S.
Mateer<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4009src" href="#xd21e4009" name=
"xd21e4009src">13</a> to practice polyandry like the Todas.</p>
<p>Ur&#257;li is further a synonym of the Tandans of Travancore, in
reference, it is said, to their having been guardians of villages (ur)
in former times. It is also the title of the headman of the Kuravas of
Travancore and a synonym of the K&#333;l&#257;yans of Malabar.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=

<p><b>Ur&#257;li.</b>&mdash;The Ur&#257;lis, who form the subject of
the present note, dwell at an altitude of 1,800 feet in the jungles of
Dimbhum in the Coimbatore district, where a forest bungalow, situated
on a breezy ridge overlooking the plains, formed a convenient centre
from which to study both Ur&#257;lis and the more primitive
Sh&#333;lagas.</p>
<p>The Ur&#257;lis are familiar with the Badagas, who have a settlement
not many miles distant; the Todas, who occasionally migrate across the
adjacent N&#299;lgiri frontier in search of grazing land for their
buffaloes; and the Kurumbas and Irulas, who inhabit the lower slopes of
the N&#299;lgiris, which run down to Coimbatore. With the civilised
world they are acquainted, as they carry loads to the plains, and run
down to market at the town of Sathyamangalam, which is only seventeen
miles distant from Dimbhum. Like the N&#299;lgiri Badagas, they are
clad in turban, and long flowing body-cloth, white (when new), or
striped with red and blue. The hair is worn long and unkempt, or shaved
<i>&aacute; la</i> Hindu with kudimi in mimicry of the more civilised
classes. A man was introduced to us as an expert mimic of the note of
the paroquet, peacock, jungle-fowl and other forest birds; and a small
party improvised, in front of the bungalow, a bird trap cleverly
constructed out of stones, an iron plate from the camp kitchen, bamboo,
and rope made on the spot from the bark of <i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus
Tsiela</i>. The making of fire with flint and steel is fast
disappearing in favour of safety matches.</p>
<p>The Ur&#257;lis say that they are men of seven kulams (<i>i.e.</i>,
having seven posts to the marriage booth), and are children of
Billayya, while they describe the Sh&#333;lagas as men of five kulams
and children of Karayya. They call themselves Ur&#257;lis or Irulas,
and, when questioned, say that, as Billayya and Karayya are brothers,
they may also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>be called Sh&#333;lagas. But there is no
intermarriage between Ur&#257;lis and Sh&#333;lagas, though members of
the two tribes sometimes interdine. According to another legend, the
Ur&#257;lis and Sh&#333;lagas are both descended from Karayan, and the
Sivach&#257;ris (Ling&#257;yats) from Billaya or M&#257;dh&#275;swaram
(<i>see</i> Sh&#333;laga). They speak a patois of mixed Tamil and
Canarese, and have a number of exogamous septs, the meaning of the
names of which is not clear. They indulge in a large repertoire of
nicknames, for the most part of a personal nature, such as
donkey-legged, big-navelled, pot-bellied, hare-lipped, hairy like a
bear or the tail of a mungoose, toothless, lying, brought up on
butter-milk. One man was named Koth&#275; Kallan (kotha, a stone),
because he was born on a rock near Kotagiri.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4039width" id="pl7-251"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">Ur&#257;li.</p>
</div>
<p>The majority of the tribe earn a modest livelihood by collecting
minor forest produce, such as myrabolams, wax and honey, and poles for
use as primitive breaks for country carts during the ascent of the
gh&#257;t road. These poles are tied to the carts by ropes, and trail
behind on the ground, so that, when the cart stops, the backward course
of the wheels is arrested. Some till the soil, and cultivate various
kinds of food-grains. Others are sheep and cattle owners. A few
families possess land, which is given free of rent by the Forest
Department, on condition that they work for the department whenever
their services are required. As a class they are not inclined to do
hard work, and they appear to get into the clutches of money-lending
Chettis. Their staple food is r&#257;gi (<i lang="la-x-bio">Eleusine
Coracana</i>). But they eat also sheep, fowls, goat, deer, pigeons and
doves, black monkeys, wild boar, hare, hedgehogs, paroquets, quails and
partridges, jungle-fowl, woodcock, woodpeckers, and other denizens of
the jungle. A man who was asked whether they eat beef, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>cats, toads, bears, or white monkeys,
expectorated violently at the mention of each, and the suggestion of
the first three produced the most explosive oral demonstration.</p>
<p>Tribal disputes are referred to a headman, called Yejamana, who must
belong to the exogamous sept called Samb&#275;, and whose appointment
is an hereditary one. To assist him, three others, belonging to the
Kalkatti, Kolkara and Kurinanga septs, whose hereditary titles are
Pattagara, Gouda and Kolkara, are appointed. The Kolkara has to invite
people to the panch&#257;yat (tribal council), collect the fines
inflicted, and be present on the occasion of marriages. A woman who,
after marriage, refuses to live with her husband, is punished thus. She
is tied to a tree, and the Kolkaran empties the contents of a hornet or
wasp&rsquo;s nest at her feet. After a few minutes the woman is
questioned, and, if she agrees to live with her husband, she must, in
token of assent, lick a mark made on his back by the Kolkara with
fowl&rsquo;s excrement, saying &ldquo;You are my husband. In future I
shall not quarrel with you, and will obey you.&rdquo; Even after this
ordeal has been gone through, a woman may, on payment of a fine, leave
her husband in favour of another man of the tribe.</p>
<p>When a girl reaches puberty, she is anointed, decorated with
jewelry, and made to occupy a separate hut for seven days, during which
time two young girls keep her company. On the eighth day, all three
bathe in a pond or stream, and return in their wet clothes to the
girl&rsquo;s home, where they sit on a pestle placed in front of the
door. A plantain leaf is then placed in front of them, on which cooked
rice and curry are spread. A child, aged about eight or nine months, is
set in the girl&rsquo;s lap, and she feeds the infant with a small
quantity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>of rice, of which she herself swallows a few
mouthfuls. Those assembled then sit down to a meal, at the conclusion
of which they wash their hands in a dish, and the girl throws the water
away. The feast concluded, the spot is sprinkled with cowdung water,
and cleaned up by the girl.</p>
<p>Marriage is either infant or adult, but, as a rule, the latter. The
match-making is carried out by the boy&rsquo;s parents, who, with his
other relations, pay two visits, one with and one without the boy, to
the parents of the girl. At the first visit a present of r&#257;gi, and
at the second of plantains, rice, and millet pudding is made. The party
must be received with due respect, which is shown by taking hold of the
walking-sticks of the guests on arrival, and receiving them on a mat
spread inside the house. The customary form of salute is touching the
feet with both hands, and raising them, with palms opposed, to the
forehead. Before taking their seats, the guests salute a vessel of
water, which is placed on the mat, surrounded by betel leaves and nuts.
A flower is placed on the top of the stone or figure which represents
the tribal goddess, and, after p&#363;ja (worship) has been done to it,
it is addressed in the words &ldquo;Oh, Sw&#257;mi! drop the flower to
the right if the marriage is going to be propitious, and to the left if
otherwise.&rdquo; Should the flower remain on the image, without
falling either way, it is greeted as a very happy omen. On the occasion
of the betrothal ceremony, if the bridegroom&rsquo;s party, on their
way to the bride&rsquo;s village, have to cross a stream, running or
dry, the bridegroom is not allowed to walk across it, but must be
carried over on the back of his maternal uncle. As they approach the
bride&rsquo;s home, they are met by the Kolkara and two other men, to
whom the Kolkara, after receiving the walking-sticks of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>the
guests, hands them over. Failure to do so would be an act of
discourtesy, and regarded as an insult to be wiped out by a heavy fine.
When the procession arrives at the house, entrance into the marriage
booth is prevented by a stick held across it by people of the
bride&rsquo;s village. A mock struggle takes place, during which
turmeric water is thrown by both sides, and an entrance into the house
is finally effected. After a meal has been partaken of, the bridal
party proceed to the village of the bridegroom, where the bride and
bridegroom are lodged in separate houses. In front of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house a booth, supported by twelve posts arranged in
four rows, has been erected. The two pillars nearest the entrance to
the house are called murthi kamba. Into the holes made for the
reception of these, after a cocoanut has been broken, gh&#299;
(clarified butter), milk, and a few copper coins are placed. The bridal
pair, after an oil bath, are led to the booth, decorated with jewels
and wearing new cloths, and made to sit on a plank. A cocoanut is
broken, and they salute a vessel placed on a plate. The bridal party
then adjourn to a pond or stream, and do p&#363;ja to their god. On the
return thence the bridal couple must be accompanied by their maternal
uncles, who should keep on dancing, while cocoanuts are broken in front
of them till the house is reached. The contracting parties then again
sit on the plank with their little fingers linked, while the bride
money (theravu) is paid to the father-in-law, and the milk money
(p&#257;l kuli) to the mother-in-law. The t&#257;li (a golden disc) is
then tied on to the bride&rsquo;s neck by some female relation of the
bridegroom, and the bride and bridegroom, after saluting those
assembled, enter the house, where the young wife is at once told to
cook some rice, of which she and her husband partake from the same leaf
plate. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span></p>
<p>There exists, among the Ur&#257;lis, a kind of informal union called
kuduvali. A man and woman will, by mutual agreement, elope into the
jungle, and live there together, till they are discovered and brought
back by their relations. A panch&#257;yat (council) is held, and they
are recognised as man and wife if the bride money and fine inflicted
are paid. Failure to pay up would render them liable to
excommunication. To celebrate the event, a feast must be given by the
man; and, if he should die without having fed the community, any
children born to him are considered as illegitimate. In such a case,
the widow or her near relatives are asked to give food to at least a
few before the corpse is removed, so as to legitimatise the
children.</p>
<p>The Ur&#257;lis bury their dead, and the death ceremonies are, to a
certain extent, copied from those of the Badagas. As soon as a member
of the tribe dies, the corpse is anointed, washed, and dressed in new
clothes and turban. On the face three silver coins are stuck,
viz.:&mdash;a rupee on the forehead, and a quarter rupee outside each
eye. When all have assembled for the funeral, the corpse is brought out
and placed under a car (t&#275;ru) of six storeys, made of bamboo and
sticks, covered with coloured cloths and flags, and having at the top a
kalasa (brass vessel) and umbrella. To the accompaniment of a band a
dance takes place around the car, and the procession then moves on to
the burial-ground, where a cow buffalo is brought near the car, and a
little milk drawn and poured three times into the mouth of the corpse.
A cow and one or two calves are taken round the car, and the calves
presented to the sister of the deceased. The car is then broken up,
after the decorations have been stripped off. The corpse is buried
either on the spot, or taken away to distant N&#299;rgundi, and buried
there. On <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>the eighth day after the funeral or return from
N&#299;rgundi, the eldest son of the deceased has his head shaved, and,
together with his brother&rsquo;s wife, fasts. If the funeral has been
at N&#299;rgundi, the son, accompanied by his relations, proceeds
thither after tying some cooked rice in a cloth. On arrival, he offers
this to all the memorial stones in the burial-ground (goppamane), and
erects a stone, which he has brought with him, in memory of the
deceased. He then anoints all the stones with gh&#299;, which is
contained in a green bamboo measure. He collects the rice, which has
been offered, and one of the party, becoming inspired, gives vent to
oracular declarations as to the season&rsquo;s prospects, the future of
the bereaved family, etc. The collected rice is regarded as sacred, and
is partaken of by all. Each sept has its own goppamane, which is a
rectangular space with mud walls on three sides. In cases in which the
corpse has been buried close to the village, the grave is marked by a
file of stones. Two or three years afterwards, the body is exhumed, and
the bones are collected, and placed in front of the house of the
deceased. All the relations weep, and the son conveys the bones to
N&#299;rgundi, where he buries them. On the eighth day he revisits the
spot, and erects a stone with the ceremonial already described.</p>
<p>The Ur&#257;lis worship a variety of minor deities, and sacrifice
sheep and goats to P&#257;lrayan. They observe two annual festivals,
viz.:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Thai nombu, when the whole house is cleaned, and
margosa (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>) twigs and spikes of
<i lang="la-x-bio">Achyranthes aspera</i> are tied together, and placed
in front of the house over the roof, or stuck into the roof overhanging
the entrance. A sumptuous repast is partaken of. This ceremonial takes
place in the month Thai (December-January). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>(<i>b</i>) In the month Vy&#257;si (March-April)
a large trough is placed close to a well, and filled with a mixture of
salt and water. The cattle, decorated with leaves and flowers, are
brought, one by one, to the trough, and made to drink the salt
water.</p>

<p class="first"><b>V&#257;da.</b>&mdash;On the coast of Ganjam and
Vizagapatam, the sea fishermen are either V&#257;das or
J&#257;l&#257;ris, both of which are Telugu castes. The fishing
operations are carried on by the men, and the fish are sold by the
women in markets and villages. Various Oriya castes, <i>e.g.</i>,
Kevuto, Kondra, Tiyoro, etc., are employed as fishermen, but only in
fresh-water. The V&#257;das seem to be a section of the Palles, with
whom they will interdine and intermarry. They call themselves V&#257;da
Balijas, though they have no claim to be regarded as Balijas. Sometimes
they are called Kal&#257;sis by Oriya people.</p>
<p>Socially the V&#257;das occupy a low position. Their language is a
corrupt and vulgar form of Telugu. The men wear a conical palm leaf
cap, such as is worn by the Pattanavan fishermen in the Tamil country.
In the presence of a superior, they remove their loin-cloth and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>place it round their neck and shoulders as a
mark of respect. Among many other castes, this would, on the contrary,
be regarded as an act of impertinence.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4155width" id="pl7-259"><img src=
"images/pl7-259.jpg" alt="V&#257;da gods." width="528" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">V&#257;da gods.</p>
</div>
<p>Like other Telugu castes, the V&#257;das have exogamous
intip&#275;rus, some of which seem to be peculiar to them, <i>e.g.</i>,
Mailapilli, Ganupilli, Sodupilli, Davulupilli. Other intip&#275;rus are
such as are common to many Telugu castes. The caste headmen are
entitled Kular&#257;ju and Pilla, and the appointments are apparently
held by members of particular septs. At Chatrap&#363;r, for example,
they belong to the Mailapilli and Vanka septs. There is also a caste
servant styled Samayan&#333;du. The headmen seem to have more power
among the V&#257;das than among other Telugu castes, and all kinds of
caste matters are referred to them for disposal. They receive a fee for
every marriage, and arrange various details in connection with the
wedding ceremonial. This is based on the Telugu type, with a few
variations. When a young man&rsquo;s relations proceed to the house of
the girl whom it is proposed that he should marry, the elders of her
family offer water in a brass vessel to their guests, if they approve
of the match. During the marriage rites, the bride and bridegroom sit
within a pandal (booth), and the men of the bridegroom&rsquo;s party
exhibit to those assembled betel leaf, areca nuts, oil, turmeric paste,
etc., in which no foreign matter, such as fragments of paper, rags,
etc., must be found. If they are discovered, a fine is inflicted.</p>
<p>There is exhibited in the Madras Museum a collection of clay
figures, such as are worshipped by fishermen on the Ganjam coast,
concerning which Mr. H. D&rsquo;A. C. Reilly writes to me as follows.
&ldquo;I am sending you specimens of the chief gods worshipped by the
fishermen. The Tahsildar of Berhamp&#363;r got them made by the potter
and carpenter, who usually make such figures for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>the
Gopalp&#363;r fishermen. I have found fishermen&rsquo;s shrines at
several places. Separate families appear to have separate shrines, some
consisting of large chatties (earthen pots), occasionally ornamented,
and turned upside down, with an opening on one side. Others are made of
brick and chunam (lime). All that I have seen had their opening towards
the sea. Two classes of figures are placed in these shrines, viz., clay
figures of gods, which are worshipped before fishing expeditions, and
when there is danger from a particular disease which they prevent; and
wooden figures of deceased relations, which are quite as imaginative as
the clay figures. Figures of gods and relations are placed in the same
family shrine. There are hundreds of gods to choose from, and the
selection appears to be a matter of family taste and tradition. The
figures, which I have sent, were made by a potter at Venkatarayapalle,
and painted by a carpenter at Uppulapathi, both villages near
Gopalp&#363;r. The Tahsildar tells me that, when he was inspecting them
at the Gopalp&#363;r travellers&rsquo; bungalow, sixty or seventy
fisher people came and worshipped them, and at first objected to their
gods being taken away. He pacified them by telling them that it was
because the Government had heard of their devotion to their gods that
they wanted to have some of them in Madras.&rdquo; The collection of
clay figures includes the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Bengali B&#257;bu wears a hat, and rides on a black horse. He
blesses the fishermen, secures large hauls of fish for them, and guards
them against danger when out fishing. It has been observed that
&ldquo;this affinity between the Ganjam fishermen and the Bengali
B&#257;bu, resulting in the apotheosis of the latter, is certainly a
striking manifestation of the catholicity of hero-worship, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>and
it would be interesting to have the origin of this particular form of
it, to know how long, and for what reasons the conception of protection
has appealed to the followers of the piscatory industry. It was Sir
George Campbell, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, who compelled his
Bengali officials, much against their inclination, to cultivate the art
of equitation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Veyyi Kannula Ammavaru, or goddess of a thousand eyes, represented
by a pot pierced with holes, in which a gingelly (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Sesamum</i>) oil light is burnt. She attends to the general
welfare of the fisher folk.</p>
<p>The chief sea goddess of the V&#257;das seems to be Orusandiamma,
whose image must be made out of the wood of the n&#299;m (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>) tree. She is supposed to have four
arms. Many of the pot temples <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262"
href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>set up on the sea-shore are
her shrines. On no account should she be provoked, lest the fishing
boat should be upset. She is regarded as constantly roaming over the
sea in a boat at night. Associated with her is a male deity, named
Ramasondi, who is her brother. His v&#257;hanam (vehicle) is an
elephant. Orusandi is worshipped separately by each family. At the time
of worship, flowers, two cloths, a fowl, a goat, and a bottle of toddy
or arrack, are carried in procession to the sea-shore. Before the
procession starts, people collect in front of the house of the person
who is doing the p&#363;ja (worship), and tie him and the goat to a
long post set up in front thereof. A toy boat is placed before the
post, and Ramasondi is invoked by a person called Mann&#257;ru, who
becomes inspired by the entrance of the deity into him. A fowl is
<span class="corr" id="xd21e4204" title=
"Source: sacrified">sacrificed</span>, and, with the boat on his head,
the Mann&#257;ru proceeds towards the shore. Orusandi is then invoked,
but does not come so easily as Ramasondi. Repeated invocations are
necessary before some one becomes inspired. The goat, post, and a pot
shrine for the goddess are taken to the shore. A small platform is
erected there, on which the shrine, smeared with chunam (lime), is
placed, and in it the image is deposited. Worship is then performed,
and the goat sacrificed if it crawls along on all fours and shivers. If
it does not do so, another goat is substituted for it. As every family
sets up its own pot shrine, the number of these is considerable, and
they extend over several furlongs.</p>
<p>The sea goddess Marulup&#333;lamma is housed in a small shed made of
date palm leaves. A goddess who is very much feared, and worshipped at
the burial-ground, is B&#363;lokamma. Her worship is carried out at
noon or midnight. She is represented by a pot, of which the neck is
removed. In the sides of the pot four holes are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>made, into each of which a twig is inserted. The
ends of the twigs are tied together with thread, so that they represent
a miniature pandal (booth). The pot is carried by a Mann&#257;ru,
dressed up like a woman in black and white cloths, together with
another pot representing Enuga Sakthi. The former is carried in the
bend of the left elbow, and the latter on the head. The pots are
accompanied in procession to the burial-ground, and on the way thither
some one becomes inspired, and narrates the following
legend:&mdash;&ldquo;I am B&#363;lokasakthi. Ages ago I was in an egg,
of which the upper half became the sky and the lower half the earth,
and was released. The moon was the mark on my forehead, and the sun was
my mirror. Seven gadhis (a measure of time) after my birth, a west wind
arose. By that time I had grown into an adult woman, and so I embraced
the wind, which impregnated me, and, after nine gadhis, Brahma was
born. He grew into a young man, and I asked him to embrace me, but he
refused, and, as a curse, I caused him to become a stone. Vishnu
underwent the same fate, but Siva promised to satisfy me, if I gave him
my third eye, shoulder-bag, and cane. This I did, and lost my power.
Then all the water disappeared, and I was covered with mud. Siva again
caused water to appear, and of it I took three handfuls, and threw them
over my body. The third handful consumed me, and reduced me to ashes.
From these were created Sarasvati, Parvati, and B&#363;lokamma. I am
that B&#363;lokamma. I asked a favour of Siva. He made me remain within
this earth, and, drawing three lines, said that I should not come out,
and should receive offerings of fowls and goats.&rdquo; At this stage,
a chicken is given to the Mann&#257;ru, who bites, and kills it. At the
burial-ground worship is performed, and a goat sacrificed. The goddess
being confined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>within the earth, no shrine is erected to her,
and she is not represented by an image. A small pandal is erected, and
the pot placed near it.</p>
<p>The goddess Kalimukkamma is represented by a paper or wooden mask
painted black, with protruding tongue. With her is associated her
brother B&#257;ithari. She is believed to be one of the sisters created
by Brahma from his face at the request of Iswara, the others being
Polamma, Maridipoli, Kothapoli, Jungapoli, Nukapoli, Runjamma, and
Kundamma. The shrine of Kalimukkamma is a low hut made of straw. At the
time of worship to her, a Mann&#257;ru, dressed up as a woman, puts on
the mask, and thus represents her. A stone slab, containing a figure of
Kalimukkamma, is carried by a woman. She is the only goddess who may be
represented by a stone. To her pigs are offered.</p>
<p>Peddamma or Polamma is represented by a wooden effigy. Along with
her, Maridiamma is also worshipped. The offerings to Peddamma consist
of a goat or sheep, and a pot of milk. A pig is sacrificed to
Maridiamma. When the people proceed in procession to the place of
worship, a toy cart is tied to the person representing Maridiamma, and
some one must carry a toy boat. At a distance from the house, the cart
is detached, and a pig is killed by an abdominal incision.</p>
<p>Samalamma is a mild goddess, with vegetarian propensities, to whom
animal food must not be offered. She is associated with the aforesaid
Bengali B&#257;bu riding on a horse. Her image may only be carried by
young girls, and grown-up women may not touch it.</p>
<p>Of the Sakthis worshipped by the V&#257;das, the chief is Koralu
Sakthi. The man who performs the worship is tied to a country cart, to
which a central stake, and a stake at each corner are attached. Dressed
up in female <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>attire, he drags the cart, with which he makes
three rounds. A chicken is then impaled on each of the corner stakes,
and a pig on the central stake.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4225width" id="pl7-265"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">V&#257;da shrines.</p>
</div>
<p>In former times, the images of the deities were made in clay, but it
has been found by experience that wooden images are more durable, and
do not require to be replaced so often. Along with the images of gods
and goddesses, the V&#257;das place figures representing deceased
relatives, after the peddadinam (final death ceremony).</p>
<p>The Mann&#257;rus are very important individuals, for not only do
they perform worship, but are consulted on many points. If a man does
not secure good catches of fish, he goes to the Mann&#257;ru, to
ascertain the cause of his bad luck. The Mann&#257;ru holds in his hand
a string, to which a stone is tied, and invokes various gods and
goddesses by name. Every time a name is mentioned, the stone either
swings to and fro like a pendulum, or performs a circular movement. If
the former occurs, it is a sign that the deity whose name has been
pronounced is the cause of the misfortune, and must be propitiated in a
suitable manner.</p>
<p><b>Vadakkupurattu.</b>&mdash;A synonym, meaning belonging to the
north side of the temple, of M&#257;r&#257;ns in Travancore.</p>
<p><b>Vadra.</b>&mdash;Vadra, Vadrangi, or Vadla is a name of a
sub-division of Telugu Kamsalas, the professional calling of which is
carpentering. It is noted, in the Gazetteer of Tanjore, that
&ldquo;wood-carving of a very fair quality is done at several places in
the Tanjore district by a class of workmen called car carpenters, from
the fact that their skill is generally exercised in carving images on
temple cars. They are found at Tanjore, Mannargudi, Tiruv&#257;daturai
and Tiruvadi, and perhaps <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>elsewhere. The workmen at the
last-named place are Vaddis. The Vaddis of the Godavari district are
also found to do wood-carving, sometimes with great skill.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Vadugan.</b>&mdash;At the census, 1891, 180,884 individuals were
returned as Vadugan, which is described as meaning &ldquo;a native of
the northern or Telugu country, but in ordinary usage it refers to the
Balijas.<span class="corr" id="xd21e4247" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> I find, however, that 56,380 Vadugars
have returned their sub-division as Kammavar or Kammas, and that the
term has been used to denote many Telugu castes. At the census, 1901,
the number of people returning themselves as Vadugan dropped to 95,924,
and the name is defined by the Census Superintendent as a
&ldquo;linguistic term meaning a Telugu man, wrongly returned as a
caste name by Kammas, K&#257;pus and Balijas in the Tamil
districts.&rdquo; In the Salem Manual, Vaduga is noted as including all
who speak Telugu in the Tamil districts, <i>e.g.</i>, Odd&#275;,
Bestha, etc.</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of Malabar, that &ldquo;of the same
social standing as the Kamm&#257;lans are the Vadugans (northerners), a
makkatt&#257;yam caste of foreigners found in Palghat and the adjoining
part of Waluvanad. They are divided into two exogamous classes, one of
which is regarded as inferior to the other, and performs purificatory
ceremonies for the caste. They cut their hair close all over the head,
and have no kudumis (hair knot).&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. L. Moore<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4257src"
href="#xd21e4257" name="xd21e4257src">1</a> that &ldquo;Xavier, writing
in 1542 to 1544, makes frequent references to men whom he calls
Badages, who are said to have been collectors of royal taxes, and to
have grievously oppressed Xavier&rsquo;s converts among the fishermen
of Travancore.<span class="corr" id="xd21e4260" title=

id="xd21e4267src" href="#xd21e4267" name="xd21e4267src">3</a> that
these Badages were no doubt Vadages or men from the North, and is of
opinion that a Jesuit writer of the time who called them Nayars was
mistaken, and that they were really Nayakans from Madura. I believe,
however, that the Jesuit rightly called them Nayars, for I find that
Father Organtino, writing in 1568, speaks of these Badages as people
from Narasinga, a kingdom north of Madura, lying close to Bishnaghur.
Bishnaghur is, of course, Vijayanagar, and the kingdom of Narasinga was
the name frequently given by the Portuguese to Vijayanagar. There is a
considerable amount of evidence to show that the Nayars of Malabar are
closely connected by origin with the Nayakans of Vijayanagar.&rdquo;

<p><b>Vaidyan.</b>&mdash;Vaidyon or Baidya, meaning physician or
medicine-man, occurs as a title of Kshaurakas, Billavas, and Pulluvans,
and, at times of census, has been returned as an occupational
sub-division of Paraiyans.</p>
<p>Village physicians are known as Vaidyans, and may belong to any
caste, high or low. The Vaidyan diagnoses all diseases by feeling the
pulse, and, after doing this for a sufficiently long time, remarks that
there is an excess of v&#257;tham, pitham, ushnam, and so on. His stock
phrases are v&#257;tham, pitham, ushnam, sl&#275;shmam, k&#257;rakam,
m&#275;gham or m&#275;ham, saithyam, etc. Orthodox men and women do not
allow the Vaidyan to feel the pulse by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>direct contact of the
fingers, and a silk cloth is placed on the patient&rsquo;s wrist. The
pulse of males is felt with the right hand, and that of females with
the left. Some Vaidyans crack the finger and wrist-joints before they
proceed to feel the pulse. Some are general practitioners, and others
specialists in the treatment of fever, piles, jaundice, syphilis,
rheumatism, and other diseases. The specialists are generally
hereditary practitioners. In the treatment of cases, the Vaidyan
prescribes powders and pills, and a decoction or infusion (kashayam) of
various drugs which can easily be obtained at the village drug-shop, or
with the help of the village herbalist. Among these are ginger, pepper,
<i lang="la-x-bio">Abies Webbiana</i>, <i lang="la-x-bio">Acorus
calamus</i>, n&#299;m (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>), or
<i lang="la-x-bio">Andrographis paniculata</i> sticks, <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Alpinia Galanga</i>, etc. If the medicine has to be taken
for a long time, the drugs are compounded together in the form of a
l&#275;hyam, <i>e.g.</i>, bilvadi, k&#363;shpanda, and purnadi
l&#275;hyam. Some Vaidyans prepare powders (basmam), such as swarna
(gold) basmam, pavala (coral powder) basmam, or s&#257;nkha (chank
shell powder) basmam. Special pills (m&#257;thre), prepared at
considerable cost, are sometimes kept by Vaidyans, and passed on from
generation to generation as heirlooms. Such pills are usually intended
for well-known specific diseases. These pills are used in very minute
quantities, and consequently last for a long time. A drop of honey or
butter is placed on a slab of sandstone, on which the pill is rubbed.
The honey or butter is then administered to the patient. A standing
rule of the Vaidyan is to keep his patient on a very low diet, such as
rice gruel without salt. His usual saying is &ldquo;Langanam
paramoushadam,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, fasting is an excellent medicine. A
well-known treatment in cases of jaundice is the drinking of curds,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>in which twigs of <i lang="la-x-bio">Phyllanthus
Niruri</i> have been well mashed.</p>
<p>In a very interesting note<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4333src" href=
"#xd21e4333" name="xd21e4333src">4</a> on couching of the lens as
practiced by native practitioners, Major R. H. Elliot, I.M.S., writes
as follows. &ldquo;The ignorance and stupidity of the ryot (villager)
is so great that he will not very infrequently try one eye in an
English hospital, and one in a Vaithyan&rsquo;s hands. It is a very
common thing for a native patient to deny ever having visited a native
doctor, when he first comes to hospital. After the other eye has been
successfully operated on, he will sometimes own up to the fact.... Here
in the south, there appear to be two classes of operators, the resident
men who live for long periods in one bazaar, and the travellers who
move continuously from place to place. Both are Mahomedans. The former
appear to get somewhat better results than the latter, and are spoken
of as &lsquo;men of experience.&rsquo; The latter seem never to stop
long in one place. They collect a number of victims, operate on them,
and then move on before their sins can find them out. Both kinds of
operators seem to be innocent of any attempt at securing asepsis or
antisepsis; they use a dirty needle or a sharp wooden skewer; no
an&aelig;sthetic is employed; a bandage is kept on for ten days, and
counter-irritation is freely resorted to, to combat iritis, etc. Many
of the victims are ashamed to come to a European hospital after the
failure of their hopes. It has been said that, if the Vaithyan did not
get good results, he would be dropped, and the practice would die out.
This remark can only have come from one who knew nothing of the Indian
character, or the crass ignorance of the lower classes of the people.
It is hard <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>for those who have not lived and worked among
them to realise how easily the ryot falls a dupe to impudent
self-advertisement. He is a simple kindly person, whose implicit trust
in confident self-assertion will bring him to grief for many another
generation. The vision of these poor unfortunate people sitting down in
a dusty bazaar to let an ignorant charlatan thrust a dirty needle into
their blind eyes has evoked the indignation of the English surgeon from
the time of our first occupation of the country. Side by side with a
well-equipped English hospital, which turns out its ninety odd per
cent. of useful vision, there sits in the neighbouring bazaar even
to-day the charlatan, whose fee is fixed at anything from 3<i>d.</i> to
8 shillings, <i>plus</i>, in every case, a fowl or other animal. The
latter is ostensibly for sacrificial purposes, but I understand ends
uniformly in the Vaithyan&rsquo;s curry-pot. Weirdest, perhaps, of all
the Vaithyan&rsquo;s methods is the use of the saffron-coloured rag,
with which pus is wiped away from the patient&rsquo;s inflamed eye. On
this colour, the pus, etc., cannot be seen, and therefore all is well.
It is the fabled ostrich again, only this time in real life, with vital
interests at stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4346src" href="#xd21e4346"

made in the world.</p>
<p><b>Valaiyal.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Kavarai, <i>i.e.</i>, the

<p><b>Valaiyan.</b>&mdash;The Valaiyans are described, in the Manual of

from their being constantly employed in netting game in the jungles.
Many of them still live by the net; some catch fish; some smelt iron.
Many are engaged in cultivation, as bearers of burdens, and in ordinary
cooly work. The tradition that a Valaiya woman was the mother of the
Vallambans seems to show that the <span class="corr" id="xd21e4423"
title="Source: Valiyans">Valaiyans</span> must be <span class=

of the most ancient castes in the country.&rdquo; In the Tanjore Manual
they are described as &ldquo;inhabitants of the country inland who live
by snaring birds, and fishing in fresh waters. They engage also in
agricultural labour and cooly work, such as carrying loads, husking
paddy (rice), and cutting and selling fire-wood. They are a poor and
degraded class.&rdquo; The Valaiyans are expert at making cunningly
devised traps for catching rats and jungle fowl. They have &ldquo;a
comical fairy-tale of the origin of the war, which still goes on
between them and the rat tribe. It relates how the chiefs of the rats
met in conclave, and devised the various means for arranging and
harassing the enemy, which they still practice with such
effect.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4428src" href="#xd21e4428"

</div>
<p>In the Census Report, 1901, the Valaiyans are described as &ldquo;a
shik&#257;ri (hunting) caste in Madura and Tanjore. In the latter the
names Ambalak&#257;ran, S&#275;rvaik&#257;ran, V&#275;dan,
Siviy&#257;n, and Kuruvikk&#257;ran are indiscriminately applied to the
caste.&rdquo; There is some connection between Ambalak&#257;rans,
Muttiriyans, Mutr&#257;chas, Ur&#257;lis, V&#275;dans, Valaiyans, and
V&#275;ttuvans, but in what it exactly consists remains to be
ascertained. It seems likely that all of them are descended from one
common parent stock. Ambalak&#257;rans claim to be descended from
Kannappa N&#257;yanar, one of the sixty-three Saivite saints, who was a
V&#275;dan or hunter by caste. In Tanjore the Valaiyans declare
themselves to have a similar origin, and in that district
Ambalak&#257;ran and Muttiriyan seem to be synonymous with Valaiyan.
Moreover, the statistics of the distribution of the Valaiyans show that
they are numerous in the districts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274"
href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>where Ambalak&#257;rans are
few, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, which looks as though certain
sections had taken to calling themselves Ambalak&#257;rans. The upper
sections of the Ambalak&#257;rans style themselves Pillai, which is a
title properly belonging to Vell&#257;las, but the others are usually
called M&#363;ppan in Tanjore, and Ambalak&#257;ran, Muttiriyan, and
S&#275;rvaik&#257;ran in Trichinopoly. The usual title of the
Valaiyans, so far as I can gather, is M&#363;ppan, but some style
themselves S&#275;rvai and Ambalak&#257;ran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Madura Valaiyans are said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4445src"
href="#xd21e4445" name="xd21e4445src">11</a> to be &ldquo;less
br&#257;hmanised than those in Tanjore, the latter employing
Br&#257;hmans as priests, forbidding the marriage of widows,
occasionally burning their dead, and being particular what they eat.
But they still cling to the worship of all the usual village gods and
goddesses.&rdquo; In some places, it is said,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4448src" href="#xd21e4448" name="xd21e4448src">12</a> the
Valaiyans will eat almost anything, including rats, cats, frogs and
squirrels.</p>
<p>Like the Pallans and Paraiyans, the Valaiyans, in some places, live
in streets of their own, or in settlements outside the villages. At
times of census, they have returned a large number of sub-divisions, of
which the following may be cited as examples:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Monathinni. Those who eat the vermin of the soil.</li>
<li>P&#257;sikatti (p&#257;si, glass bead).</li>
<li>Saragu, withered leaves.</li>
<li>Vanniyan. Synonym of the Palli caste.</li>
<li>Vell&#257;mputtu, white-ant hill.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some places the Saruku or Saragu Valaiyans have exogamous
k&#299;lais or septs, which, as among the Maravans and Kallans, run in
the female line. Brothers and sisters belong to the same k&#299;lai as
that of their mother and maternal uncle, and not of their father.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is stated, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that
&ldquo;the Valaiyans are grouped into four endogamous sub-divisions,
namely, Vahni, Valattu, Karadi, and Kangu. The last of these is again
divided into P&#257;sikatti, those who use a bead necklet instead of a
t&#257;li (as a marriage badge), and K&#257;raikatti, those whose women
wear horsehair necklaces like the Kallans. The caste title is
M&#363;ppan. Caste matters are settled by a headman called the
Kambliyan (blanket man), who lives at Aruppuk&#333;ttai, and comes
round in state to any village which requires his services, seated on a
horse, and accompanied by servants who hold an umbrella over his head
and fan him. He holds his court seated on a blanket. The fines imposed
go in equal shares to the aramanai (literally palace, <i>i.e.</i>, to
the headman himself), and to the oramanai, that is, the caste
people.</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. F. R. Hemingway that &ldquo;the Valaiyans of the
Trichinopoly district say that they have eight endogamous
sub-divisions, namely, Sarahu (or Saragu), Ettarai K&#333;ppu,
T&#257;namban&#257;du or Valuv&#257;di, Nadun&#257;ttu or Asal,
Kurumba, Vanniya, Ambun&#257;du, and Punal. Some of these are similar
to those of the Kallans and Ambalak&#257;rans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Gazetteer of the Tanjore district, it is recorded that the
Valaiyans are said to possess &ldquo;endogamous sub-divisions called
V&#275;dan, Sulundukk&#257;ran and Ambalakk&#257;ran. The members of
the first are said to be hunters, those of the second torch-bearers,
and those of the last cultivators. They are a low caste, are refused
admittance into the temples, and pollute a Vell&#257;lan by touch.
Their occupations are chiefly cultivation of a low order, cooly work,
and hunting. They are also said to be addicted to crime, being employed
by Kallans as their tools.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276"
href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span></p>
<p>Adult marriage is the rule, and the consent of the maternal uncle is
necessary. Remarriage of widows is freely permitted. At the marriage
ceremony, the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister takes up the t&#257;li
(marriage badge), and, after showing it to those assembled, ties it
tightly round the neck of the bride. To tie it loosely so that the
t&#257;li string touches the collar-bone would be considered a breach
of custom, and the woman who tied it would be fined. The
t&#257;li-tying ceremony always takes place at night, and the
bridegroom&rsquo;s sister performs it, as, if it was tied by the
bridegroom, it could not be removed on his death, and replaced if his
widow wished to marry again. Marriages generally take place from
January to May, and consummation should not be effected till the end of
the month &#256;di, lest the first child should be born in the month of
Chithre, which would be very inauspicious. There are two Tamil proverbs
to the effect that &ldquo;the girl should remain in her mother&rsquo;s
house during &#256;di,&rdquo; and &ldquo;if a child is born in Chithre,
it is ruinous to the house of the mother-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Gazetteer of the Madura district, it is stated that &ldquo;at
weddings, the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister ties the t&#257;li, and then
hurries the bride off to her brother&rsquo;s house, where he is
waiting. When a girl attains maturity, she is made to live for a
fortnight in a temporary hut, which she afterwards burns down. While
she is there, the little girls of the caste meet outside it, and sing a
song illustrative of the charms of womanhood, and its power of
alleviating the unhappy lot of the bachelor. Two of the verses
say:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">What of the hair of a man?</p>
<p class="line">It is twisted, and matted, and a burden.</p>
<p class="line">What of the tresses of a woman?</p>
<p class="line">They are as flowers in a garland, and a glory.</p>
</div>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">What of the life of a man?</p>
<p class="line">It is that of the dog at the palace gate.</p>
<p class="line">What of the days of a woman?</p>
<p class="line">They are like the gently waving leaves in a
festoon.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Divorce is readily permitted on the usual
payments, and divorc&eacute;es and widows may remarry. A married woman
who goes astray is brought before the Kambliyan, who delivers a homily,
and then orders the man&rsquo;s waist-string to be tied round her neck.
This legitimatises any children they may have.&rdquo; The Valaiyans of
Pattukk&#333;ttai in the Tanjore district say that intimacy between a
man and woman before marriage is tolerated, and that the children of
such a union are regarded as members of the caste, and permitted to
intermarry with others, provided the parents pay a nominal penalty
imposed by the caste council.</p>
<p>In connection with the Valaiyans of the Trichinopoly district, Mr.
Hemingway writes that &ldquo;they recognise three forms of marriage,
the most usual of which consists in the bridegroom&rsquo;s party going
to the girl&rsquo;s house with three marakk&#257;ls of rice and a cock
on an auspicious day, and in both parties having a feast there.
Sometimes the young man&rsquo;s sister goes to the girl&rsquo;s house,
ties a t&#257;li round her neck, and takes her away. The ordinary form
of marriage, called big marriage, is sometimes used with variations,
but the Valaiyans do not like it, and say that the two other forms
result in more prolific unions. They tolerate unchastity before
marriage, and allow parties to marry even after several children have
been born, the marriage legitimatising them. They permit remarriage of
widows and divorced women. Women convicted of immorality are garlanded
with erukku (<i lang="la-x-bio">Calotropis gigantea</i>) flowers, and
made to carry a basket of mud round the village. Men who too frequently
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>offend in this respect are made to sit with
their toes tied to the neck by a creeper. When a woman is divorced, her
male children go to the husband, and she is allowed to keep the
girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tribal gods of the Valaiyans are Singa Pid&#257;ri (Aiyanar) and
Padinett&#257;mpadi Karuppan. Once a year, on the day after the
new-moon in the month M&#257;si (February to March), the Valaiyans
assemble to worship the deity. Early in the morning they proceed to the
Aiyanar temple, and, after doing homage to the god, go off to the
forest to hunt hares and other small game. On their return they are met
by the Valaiyan matrons carrying coloured water or rice
(&#257;l&#257;m), garlands of flowers, betel leaves and areca nuts. The
&#257;l&#257;m is waved over the men, some of whom become inspired and
are garlanded. While they are under inspiration, the mothers appeal to
them to name their babies. The products of the chase are taken to the
house of the headman and distributed. At a festival, at which Mr. K.
Rangachari was present, at about ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning all
the Valaiya men, women, and children, dressed up in holiday attire,
swarmed out of their huts, and proceeded to a neighbouring grove. The
men and boys each carried a throwing stick, or a digging stick tipped
with iron. On arrival at the grove, they stood in a row, facing east,
and, throwing down their sticks, saluted them, and prostrated
themselves before them. Then all took up their sticks, and some played
on reed pipes. Some of the women brought garlands of flowers, and
placed them round the necks of four men, who for a time stood holding
in their hands their sticks, of which the ends were stuck in the
ground. After a time they began to shiver, move quickly about, and kick
those around them. Under the influence of their inspiration, they
exhibited <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>remarkable physical strength, and five or six
men could not hold them. Calling various people by name, they expressed
a hope that they would respect the gods, worship them, and offer to
them pongal (boiled rice) and animal sacrifices. The women brought
their babies to them to be named. In some places, the naming of infants
is performed at the Aiyanar temple by any one who is under the
influence of inspiration. Failing such a one, several flowers, each
with a name attached to it, are thrown in front of the idol. A boy, or
the p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest) picks up one of the flowers, and the
infant receives the name which is connected with it.</p>
<p>The Valaiyans are devoted to devil worship, and, at Orattan&#257;du
in the Tanjore district, every Valaiyan backyard is said to contain an
odiyan (<i lang="la-x-bio">Odina Wodier</i>) tree, in which the devil
is supposed to live.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4523src" href=
"#xd21e4523" name="xd21e4523src">13</a> It is noted by Mr. W.
Francis<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4526src" href="#xd21e4526" name=
"xd21e4526src">14</a> that &ldquo;certain of the Valaiyans who live at
Ammayan&#257;yakkan&#363;r are the hereditary p&#363;j&#257;ris to the
gods of the Sirumalai hills. Some of these deities are uncommon, and
one of them, P&#257;pp&#257;rayan, is said to be the spirit of a
Br&#257;hman astrologer whose monsoon forecast was falsified by events,
and who, filled with a shame rare in unsuccessful weather prophets,
threw himself off a high point on the range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hemingway, the Valaiyans have a special caste god,
named Mutt&#257;l R&#257;vuttan, who is the spirit of a dead
Muhammadan, about whom nothing seems to be known.</p>
<p>The dead are as a rule buried with rites similar to those of the
Kallans and Agamudaiyans. The final death ceremonies
(karm&#257;ndhiram) are performed on the sixteenth day. On the night of
the previous day, a vessel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href=
"#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>filled with water is placed on the
spot where the deceased breathed his last, and two cocoanuts, with the
pores (&rsquo;eyes&rsquo;) open, are deposited near it. On the
following morning, all proceed to a grove or tank (pond). The eldest
son, or other celebrant, after shaving and bathing, marks out a square
space on the ground, and, placing a few dry twigs of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Ficus religiosa</i> and <i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus
bengalensis</i> therein, sets fire to them. Presents of rice and other
food-stuffs are given to beggars and others. The ceremony closes with
the son and sapindas, who have to observe pollution, placing new cloths
on their heads. Mr. Francis records that, at the funeral ceremonies,
&ldquo;the relations go three times round a basket of grain placed
under a pandal (booth), beating their breasts and singing:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">For us the kanji (rice gruel): kail&#257;sam (the abode
of Siva) for thee;</p>
<p class="line">Rice for us; for thee Svargal&#333;kam,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and then wind turbans round the head of the
deceased&rsquo;s heir, in recognition of his new position as chief of
the family. When a woman loses her husband, she goes three times round
the village mandai (common), with a pot of water on her shoulder. After
each of the first two journeys, the barber makes a hole in the pot, and
at the end of the third he hurls down the vessel, and cries out an
adjuration to the departed spirit to leave the widow and children in
peace.&rdquo; It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the Tanjore district,
that &ldquo;one of the funeral ceremonies is peculiar, though it is
paralleled by practices among the Paraiyans and Karaiy&#257;ns. When
the heir departs to the burning-ground on the second day, a mortar is
placed near the outer door of his house, and a lamp is lit inside. On
his return, he has to upset the mortar, and worship the light.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=

<p><b>V&#257;lan.</b>&mdash;For the following note on the V&#257;lan
and Katal Arayan fishing castes of the Cochin State, I am indebted to
Mr. L. K. Anantha Krishna Aiyar.</p>
<p>The name V&#257;lan is derived from vala, meaning fish in a tank.
Some consider the word to be another form of Valayan, which signifies a
person who throws a net for fishing. According to the tradition and
current belief of these people, they were brought to K&#275;rala by
Parasur&#257;ma for plying boats and conveying passengers across the
rivers and backwaters on the west coast. Another tradition is that the
V&#257;lans were Arayans, and they became a separate caste only after
one of the Perum&#257;ls had selected some of their families for boat
service, and conferred on them special privileges. They even now pride
themselves that their caste is one of remote antiquity, and that
Vedavyasa, the author of the Pur&#257;nas, and Guha, who rendered the
boat service to the divine R&#257;ma, Sita, and Lakshmana, across the
Ganges in the course of their exile to the forest, were among the
caste-men.</p>
<p>There are no sub-divisions in the caste, but the members thereof are
said to belong to four exogamous illams (houses of Namb&#363;tiris),
namely, Alayakad, Ennalu, Vaisyagiriam, and Vazhapally, which
correspond to the g&#333;tras of the Br&#257;hmans, or to four clans,
the members of each of which are perhaps descended from a common
ancestor. According to a tradition current among them, they were once
attached to the four Namb&#363;tiri illams above mentioned for service
of some kind, and were even the descendants of the members of the
illams, but were doomed to the present state of degradation on account
of some misconduct. Evidently, the story is looked up to to elevate
themselves in social status. I am inclined to believe that they must
have been the Atiyars <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href=
"#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>(slaves) of the four aforesaid
Br&#257;hman families, owing a kind of allegiance (nambikooru) like the
Kanakkans to the Chittur Manakkal Namb&#363;trip&#257;d in Perumanam of
the Trichur t&#257;luk. Even now, these Br&#257;hman families are held
in great respect by the V&#257;lans, who, when afflicted with family
calamities, visit the respective illams with presents of a few packets
of betel leaves and a few annas, to receive the blessings of their
Br&#257;hman masters, which, according to their belief, may tend to
avert them.</p>
<p>The low sandy tract of land on each side of the backwater is the
abode of these fishermen. In some places, more especially south of
Cranganore, their houses are dotted along the banks of the backwater,
often nearly hidden by cocoanut trees, while at intervals the white
picturesque fronts of numerous Roman Catholic and Romo-Syrian churches
are perceived. These houses are in fact mere flimsy huts, a few of
which, occupied by the members of several families, may be seen huddled
together in the same compound abounding in a growth of cocoanut trees,
with hardly enough space to dry their fish and nets. In the majority of
cases, the compounds belong to jenmis (landlords), who lease them out
either rent-free or on nominal rent, and who often are so kind as to
allow them some cocoanuts for their consumption, and leaves sufficient
to thatch their houses. About ten per cent. of their houses are built
of wood and stones, while a large majority of them are made of mud or
bamboo framework, and hardly spacious enough to accommodate the members
of the family during the summer months. Cooking is done outside the
house, and very few take rest inside after hard work, for their
compounds are shady and breezy, and they may be seen basking in the sun
after midnight toil, or drying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283"
href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>the nets or fish. Their
utensils are few, consisting of earthen vessels and enamel dishes, and
their furniture of a few wooden planks and coarse mats to serve as
beds.</p>
<p>The girls of the V&#257;lans are married both before and after
puberty, but the t&#257;li-kettu kaly&#257;nam (t&#257;li-tying
marriage) is indispensable before they come of age, as otherwise they
and their parents are put out of caste. Both for the t&#257;li-tying
ceremony and for the real marriage, the bride and bridegroom must be of
different illams or g&#333;tras. In regard to the former, as soon as an
auspicious day is fixed, the girl&rsquo;s party visit the Aravan with a
present of six annas and eight pies, and a few packets of betel leaves,
when he gives his permission, and issues an order to the Ponamban, his
subordinate of the kadavu (village), to see that the ceremony is
properly conducted. The Ponamban, the bridegroom and his party, go to
the house of the bride. At the appointed hour, the Ponambans and the
castemen of the two kadavus assemble after depositing six annas and
eight pies in recognition of the presence of the Aravan, and the
t&#257;li is handed over by the priest to the bridegroom, who ties it
round the neck of the bride amidst the joyous shouts of the multitude
assembled. The ceremony always takes place at night, and the
festivities generally last for two days. It must be understood that the
t&#257;li tier is not necessarily the husband of the girl, but is
merely the pseudo-bridegroom or pseudo-husband, who is sent away with
two pieces of cloth and a few annas at the termination of the ceremony.
Should he, however, wish to have the girl as his wife, he should, at
his own expense, provide her with a t&#257;li, a wedding dress, and a
few rupees as the price of the bride. Generally it is the maternal
uncle of the girl who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href=
"#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>provides her with the first two at
the time of the ceremony.</p>
<p>The actual marriage is more ceremonial in its nature. The maternal
uncle, or the father of a young V&#257;lan who wishes to marry, first
visits the girl, and, if he approves of the match for his nephew or
son, the astrologer is consulted so as to ensure that the horoscopes
agree. If astrology does not stand in the way, they forthwith proceed
to the girl&rsquo;s house, where they are well entertained. The
bride&rsquo;s parents and relatives return the visit at the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house, where they are likewise treated to a feast.
The two parties then decide on a day for the formal declaration of the
proposed union. On that day, a V&#257;lan from the bridegroom&rsquo;s
village, seven to nine elders, and the Ponamban under whom the bride
is, meet, and, in the presence of those assembled, a V&#257;lan from
each party deposits on a plank four annas and a few betel leaves in
token of enangu m&#257;ttam or exchange of co-castemen from each party
for the due fulfilment of the contract thus publicly entered into. Then
they fix the date of the marriage, and retire from the bride&rsquo;s
house. On the appointed day, the bridegroom&rsquo;s party proceed to
the bride&rsquo;s house with two pieces of cloth, a rupee or a rupee
and a half, rice, packets of betel leaves, etc. The bride is already
dressed and adorned in her best, and one piece of cloth, rice and
money, are paid to her mother as the price of the bride. After a feast,
the bridal party go to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, which is entered
at an auspicious hour. They are received at the gate with a lamp and a
vessel of water, a small quantity of which is sprinkled on the married
couple. They are welcomed by the seniors of the house and seated
together, when sweets are given, and the bride is formally declared to
be a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>member of the bridegroom&rsquo;s family. The
ceremony closes with a feast, the expenses in connection with which are
the same on both sides.</p>
<p>A man may marry more than one wife, but no woman may enter into
conjugal relations with more than one man. A widow may, with the
consent of her parents, enter into wedlock with any member of her caste
except her brothers-in-law, in which case her children by her first
husband will be looked after by the members of his family. Divorce is
effected by either party making an application to the Aravan, who has
to be presented with from twelve annas to six rupees and a half
according to the means of the applicant. The Aravan, in token of
dissolution, issues a letter to the members of the particular village
to which the applicant belongs, and, on the declaration of the same, he
or she has to pay to his or her village castemen four annas.</p>
<p>When a V&#257;lan girl comes of age, she is lodged in a room of the
house, and is under pollution for four days. She is bathed on the
fourth day, and the castemen and women of the neighbourhood, with the
relatives and friends, are treated to a sumptuous dinner. There is a
curious custom called theralikka, <i>i.e.</i>, causing the girl to
attain maturity, which consists in placing her in seclusion in a
separate room, and proclaiming that she has come of age. Under such
circumstances, the caste-women of the neighbourhood, with the
washerwoman, assemble at the house of the girl, when the latter pours a
small quantity of gingelly (<i lang="la-x-bio">Sesamum</i>) oil on her
head, and rubs her body with turmeric powder, after which she is
proclaimed as having attained puberty. She is bathed, and lodged in a
separate room as before, and the four days&rsquo; pollution is
observed. This custom, which exists also among other castes,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>is now being abandoned by a large majority of
the community.</p>
<p>In respect of inheritance, the V&#257;lans follow a system, which
partakes of the character of succession from father to son, and from
maternal uncle to nephew. The self-acquired property is generally
divided equally between brothers and sons, while the ancestral
property, if any, goes to the brothers. The great majority of the
V&#257;lans are mere day-labourers, and the property usually consists
of a few tools, implements, or other equipments of their calling.</p>
<p>The V&#257;lans, like other castes, have their tribal organisation,
and their headman (Aravan or Aravar) is appointed by th&#299;tturam or
writ issued by His Highness the R&#257;ja. The Aravan appoints other
social heads, called Ponamban, one, two, or three of whom are stationed
at each d&#275;sam (village) or kadavu. Before the development of the
Government authority and the establishment of administrative
departments, the Aravans wielded great influence and authority, as they
still do to a limited extent, not only in matters social, but also in
civil and criminal disputes between members of the community. For all
social functions, matrimonial, funeral, etc., their permission has to
be obtained and paid for. The members of the community have to visit
their headman, with presents of betel leaves, money, and sometimes rice
and paddy (unhusked rice). The headman generally directs the proper
conduct of all ceremonies by writs issued to the Ponambans under him.
The Ponambans also are entitled to small perquisites on ceremonial
occasions. The appointment of Aravan, though not virtually hereditary,
passes at his death to the next qualified senior member of his family,
who may be his brother, son, or nephew, but this rule has been violated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>by the appointment of a person from a different
family. The Aravan has the honour of receiving from His Highness the
R&#257;ja a present of two cloths at the &#332;nam festival, six annas
and eight pies on the Athachamayam day, and a similar sum for the
Vishu. At his death, the ruler of the State sends a piece of silk
cloth, a piece of sandal-wood, and about ten rupees, for defraying the
expenses of the funeral ceremonies.</p>
<p>The V&#257;lans profess Hinduism, and Siva, Vishnu, and the heroes
of the Hindu Pur&#257;nas are all worshipped. Like other castes, they
entertain special reverence for Bhagavathi, who is propitiated with
offerings of rice-flour, toddy, green cocoanuts, plantain fruits, and
fowls, on Tuesdays and Fridays. A grand festival, called Kumbhom
Bharani (cock festival), is held in the middle of March, when
N&#257;yars and low caste men offer up cocks to Bhagavathi, beseeching
immunity from diseases during the ensuing year. In fact, people from
all parts of Malabar, Cochin, and Travancore, attend the festival, and
the whole country near the line of march rings with shouts of
&ldquo;Nada, nada&rdquo; (walk or march) of the pilgrims to Cranganore,
the holy residence of the goddess. In their passage up to the shrine,
the cry of &ldquo;Nada, nada&rdquo; is varied by unmeasured abuse of
the goddess. The abusive language, it is believed, is acceptable to
her, and, on arrival at the shrine, they desecrate it in every
conceivable manner, in the belief that this too is acceptable. They
throw stones and filth, howling volleys of abuse at the shrine. The
chief of the Arayan caste, Koolimuttah Arayan, has the privilege of
being the first to be present on the occasion. The image in the temple
is said to have been recently introduced. There is a door in the temple
which is apparently of stone, fixed in a half-opened position. A
tradition, believed by Hindus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288"
href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>and Christians, is attached
to this, which asserts that St. Thomas and Bhagavathi held a discussion
at Palliport about the respective merits of the Christian and Hindu
religions. The argument became heated, and Bhagavathi, considering it
best to cease further discussion, decamped, and, jumping across the
Cranganore river, made straight for the temple. St. Thomas, not to be
outdone, rapidly gave chase, and, just as the deity got inside the
door, the saint reached its outside, and, setting his foot between it
and the door-post, prevented its closure. There they both stood until
the door turned to stone, one not allowing its being opened, and the
other its being shut.</p>
<p>Another important festival, which is held at Cranganore, is the
Makara Vilakku, which falls on the first of Makaram (about the 15th
January), during the night of which there is a good deal of
illumination both in and round the temple. A procession of ten or
twelve elephants, all fully decorated, goes round it several times,
accompanied by drums and instrumental music.</p>
<p>Chourimala Iyappan or S&#257;stha, a sylvan deity, whose abode is
Chourimala in Travancore, is a favourite deity of the V&#257;lans. In
addition, they worship the demi-gods or demons Kallachan Muri and Kochu
Mallan, who are ever disposed to do them harm, and who are therefore
propitiated with offerings of fowls. They have a patron, who is also
worshipped at Cranganore. The spirits of their ancestors are also held
in great veneration by these people, and are propitiated with offerings
on the new moon and Sankranthi days of Karkadakam, Thulam, and
Makaram.</p>
<p>The most important festivals observed by the V&#257;lans in common
with other castes are Mandalam Vilakku, Sivar&#257;thri, Vishu,
&#332;nam, and Desara. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href=
"#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mandalam Vilakku takes place during the last seven days of Mandalam
(November to December). During this festival the V&#257;lans enjoy
themselves with music and drum-beating during the day. At night, some
of them, developing hysterical fits, profess to be oracles, with demons
such as Gandharva, Yakshi, or Bhagavathi, dwelling in their bodies in
their incorporeal forms. Consultations are held as to future events,
and their advice is thankfully received and acted upon. Sacrifices of
sheep, fowls, green cocoanuts, and plantain fruits are offered to the
demons believed to be residing within, and are afterwards liberally
distributed among the castemen and others present.</p>
<p>The Sivar&#257;thri festival comes on the last day of Magha. The
whole day and night are devoted to the worship of Siva, and the
V&#257;lans, like other castes, go to Alvai, bathe in the river, and
keep awake during the night, reading the Siva Pur&#257;na and reciting
his names. Early on the following morning, they bathe, and make
offerings of rice balls to the spirits of the ancestors before
returning home.</p>
<p>The V&#257;lans have no temples of their own, but, on all important
occasions, worship the deities of the temples of the higher castes,
standing at a long distance from the outer walls of the sacred edifice.
On important religious occasions, Embrans are invited to perform the
Kalasam ceremony, for which they are liberally rewarded. A kalasam is a
pot, which is filled with water. Mango leaves and dharba grass are
placed in it. V&#275;dic hymns are repeated, with one end of the grass
in the water, and the other in the hand. Water thus sanctified is used
for bathing the image. From a comparison of the religion of the
V&#257;lans with that of allied castes, it may be safely said that they
were animists, but have rapidly imbibed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>the higher forms of
worship. They are becoming more and more literate, and this helps the
study of the religious works. There are some among them, who compose
Vanchip&#257;ttu (songs sung while rowing) with plots from their
Pur&#257;nic studies.</p>
<p>The V&#257;lans either burn or bury their dead. The chief mourner is
either the son or nephew of the dead person, and he performs the death
ceremonies as directed by the priest (Chithayan), who attends wearing a
new cloth, turban, and the sacred thread. The ceremonies commence on
the second, fifth, or seventh day, when the chief mourner, bathing
early in the morning, offers pinda bali (offerings of rice balls) to
the spirit of the deceased. This is continued till the thirteenth day,
when the nearest relatives get shaved. On the fifteenth day, the
castemen of the locality, the friends and relatives, are treated to a
grand dinner, and, on the sixteenth day, another offering (mana pindam)
is made to the spirit of the departed, and thrown into the backwater
close by. Every day during the ceremonies, a vessel full of rice is
given to the priest, who also receives ten rupees for his services. If
the death ceremonies are not properly performed, the ghost of the
deceased is believed to haunt the house. An astrologer is then
consulted, and his advice is invariably followed. What is called
Samhara H&#333;mam (sacred fire) is kept up, and an image of the dead
man in silver or gold is purified by the recitation of holy mantrams.
Another purificatory ceremony is performed, after which the image is
handed over to a priest at the temple, with a rupee or two. This done,
the death ceremonies are performed.</p>
<p>The ears of V&#257;lan girls are, as among some other castes,
pierced when they are a year old, or even less, and a small quill, a
piece of cotton thread, or a bit of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>wood, is inserted
into the hole. The wound is gradually healed by the application of
cocoanut oil. A piece of lead is then inserted in the hole, which is
gradually enlarged by means of a piece of plantain, cocoanut, or
palmyra leaf rolled up.</p>
<p>The V&#257;lans are expert rowers, and possess the special privilege
of rowing from Thripunathura the boat of His Highness the R&#257;ja for
his installation at the Cochin palace, when the Aravan, with sword in
hand, has to stand in front of him in the boat. Further, on the
occasion of any journey of the R&#257;ja along the backwaters on
occasions of State functions, such as a visit of the Governor of
Madras, or other dignitary, the headman leads the way as an escort in a
snake-boat rowed with paddles, and has to supply the requisite number
of men for rowing the boats of the high official and his retinue.</p>
<p>The Katal Arayans, or sea Arayans, who are also called Katakkoti,
are lower in status than the V&#257;lans, and, like them, live along
the coast. They were of great service to the Portuguese and the Dutch
in their palmy days, acting as boatmen in transhipping their
commodities and supplying them with fish. The Katal Arayans were, in
former times, owing to their social degradation, precluded from
travelling along the public roads. This disability was, during the days
of the Portuguese supremacy, taken advantage of by the Roman Catholic
missionaries, who turned their attention to the conversion of these
poor fishermen, a large number of whom were thus elevated in the social
scale. The Katal Arayans are sea fishermen. On the death of a prince of
Malabar, all fishing is temporarily prohibited, and only renewed after
three days, when the spirit of the departed is supposed to have had
time enough to choose its abode without molestation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p>Among their own community, the Katal Arayans distinguish themselves
by four distinct appellations, viz., Sankhan, Bharatan, Amukkuvan, and
Mukkuvan. Of these, Amukkuvans do priestly functions. The castemen
belong to four septs or illams, namely, Kattotillam, Karotillam,
Chempotillam, and Ponnotillam.</p>
<p>Katal Arayan girls are married both before and after puberty. The
t&#257;li-tying ceremony, which is compulsory in the case of V&#257;lan
girls before they come of age, is put off, and takes place along with
the real marriage. The preliminary <span class="corr" id="xd21e4626"
title="Source: negociations">negotiations</span> and settlements
thereof are substantially the same as those prevailing among the
V&#257;lans. The auspicious hour for marriage is between three and
eight in the morning, and, on the previous evening, the bridegroom and
his party arrive at the house of the bride, where they are welcomed and
treated to a grand feast, after which the guests, along with the bride
and bridegroom seated somewhat apart, in a pandal tastefully decorated
and brightly illuminated, are entertained with songs of the V&#275;lan
(washerman) and his wife alluding to the marriage of S&#299;ta or
Parvathi, in the belief that they will bring about a happy conjugal
union. These are continued till sunrise, when the priest hands over the
marriage badge to the bridegroom, who ties it round the neck of the
bride. The songs are again continued for an hour or two, after which
poli begins. The guests who have assembled contribute a rupee, eight
annas, or four annas, according to their means, which go towards the
remuneration of the priest, songsters, and drummers. The guests are
again sumptuously entertained at twelve o&rsquo;clock, after which the
bridegroom and his party return with the bride to his house. At the
time of departure, or nearly an hour before it, the bridegroom ties a
few rupees or a sovereign to a corner <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb293" href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>of the bride&rsquo;s
body-cloth, probably to induce her to accompany him. Just then, the
bride-price, which is 101 puthans, or Rs. 5&ndash;12&ndash;4, is paid
to her parents. The bridal party is entertained at the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house, where, at an auspicious hour, the newly
married couple are seated together, and served with a few pieces of
plantain fruits and some milk, when the bride is formally declared to
be a member of her husband&rsquo;s family. If a girl attains maturity
after her marriage, she is secluded for a period of eleven days. She
bathes on the first, fourth, seventh, and eleventh days, and, on the
last day the caste people are entertained with a grand feast, the
expenses connected with which are met by the husband. The Katal Arayans
rarely have more than one wife. A widow may, a year after the death of
her husband, enter into conjugal relations with any member of the
caste, except her brother-in-law. Succession is in the male line.</p>
<p>The Katal Arayans have headmen (Aravans), whose duties are the same
as those of the headmen of the V&#257;lans. When the senior male or
female member of the ruling family dies, the Aravan has the special
privilege of being the first successor to the masnad with his tirumul
kazcha (nuzzer), which consists of a small quantity of salt packed in a
plantain leaf with rope and a Venetian ducat or other gold coin. During
the period of mourning, visits of condolence from durbar officials and
sthanis or noblemen are received only after the Aravan&rsquo;s visit.
When the Bhagavathi temple of Cranganore is defiled during the cock
festival, Koolimutteth Aravan has the special privilege of entering the
temple in preference to other castemen.</p>
<p>The Katal Arayans profess Hinduism, and their modes of worship, and
other religious observances, are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294"
href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>the same as those of the
V&#275;lans. The dead are either burnt or buried. The period of death
pollution is eleven days, and the agnates are freed from it by a bath
on the eleventh day. On the twelfth day, the castemen of the village,
including the relatives and friends, are treated to a grand feast. The
son, who is the chief mourner, observes the d&#299;ksha, or vow by
which he does not shave, for a year. He performs the sr&#257;dha
(memorial service) every year in honour of the dead.</p>
<p>Some of the methods of catching fish at Cochin are thus described by
Dr. Francis Day.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4639src" href="#xd21e4639"
name="xd21e4639src">15</a> &ldquo;Cast nets are employed from the
shore, by a number of fishermen, who station themselves either in the
early morning or in the afternoon, along the coast from 50 to 100 yards
apart. They keep a careful watch on the water, and, on perceiving a
fish rise sufficiently near the land, rush down and attempt to throw
their nets over it. This is not done as in Europe by twisting the net
round and round the head until it has acquired the necessary impetus,
and then throwing it; but by the person twirling himself and the net
round and round at the same time, and then casting it. He not
<span class="corr" id="xd21e4642" title=
"Source: unfrequently">infrequently</span> gets knocked over by a wave.
When fish are caught, they are buried in the sand, to prevent their
tainting. In the wide inland rivers, fishermen employ cast nets in the
following manner. Each man is in a boat, which is propelled by a boy
with a bamboo. The fisherman has a cast net, and a small empty cocoanut
shell. This last he throws into the river, about twenty yards before
the boat, and it comes down with a splash, said to be done to scare
away the crocodiles. As the boat approaches the place where the
cocoanut shell was thrown, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295"
href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>man casts his net around the
spot. This method is only for obtaining small fish, and as many as
fifteen boats at a time are to be seen thus employed in one place, one
following the other in rapid succession, some trying the centre, others
the sides of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Double rows of long bamboos, firmly fixed in the mud, are
placed at intervals across the backwater, and on these nets are fixed
at the flood tide, so that fish which have entered are unable to return
to the sea. Numbers of very large ones are occasionally captured in
this way. A species of Chinese nets is also used along the
river&rsquo;s banks. They are about 16 feet square, suspended by
bamboos from each corner, and let down like buckets into the water, and
then after a few minutes drawn up again. A piece of string, to which
are attached portions of the white leaves of the cocoanut tree, is tied
at short intervals along the ebb side of the net, which effectually
prevents fish from going that way. A plan somewhat analogous is
employed on a small scale for catching crabs. A net three feet square
is supported at the four corners by two pieces of stick fastened
crosswise. From the centre of these sticks where they cross is a string
to pull it up by or let it down, and a piece of meat is tied to the
middle of the net inside. This is let down from a wharf, left under
water for a few minutes, and then pulled up. Crabs coming to feed are
thus caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fishing with a line is seldom attempted in the deep sea,
excepting for sharks, rays, and other large fish. The hooks employed
are of two descriptions, the roughest, although perhaps the strongest,
being of native manufacture; the others are of English make,
denominated China hooks. The hook is fastened to a species of fibre
called thumboo, said to be derived from <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>a seaweed, but more
probably from one of the species of palms. The lines are either hemp,
cotton, or the fibre of the talipot palm (<i lang="la-x-bio">Caryota
urens</i>), which is obtained by maceration. In Europe they are called
Indian gut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trolling from the shore at the river&rsquo;s mouth is only
carried on of a morning or evening, during the winter months of the
year, when the sea is smooth. The line is from 80 to 100 yards in
length, and held wound round the left hand; the hook is fastened to the
line by a brass wire, and the bait is a live fish. The fisherman, after
giving the line an impetus by twirling it round and round his head,
throws it with great precision from 50 to 60 yards. A man is always
close by with a cast net, catching baits, which he sells for one
quarter of an anna each. This mode of fishing is very exciting sport,
but is very uncertain in its results, and therefore usually carried on
by coolies either before their day&rsquo;s work has commenced, or after
its termination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fishing with a bait continues all day long in Cochin during
the monsoon months, when work is almost at a standstill, and five or
six persons may be perceived at each jetty, busily engaged in this
occupation. The <i>Bagrus</i> tribe is then plentiful, and, as it bites
readily, large numbers are captured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fishing in small boats appears at times to be a dangerous
occupation; the small canoe only steadied by the paddle of one man
seated in it looks as if it must every minute be swamped. Very large
fish are sometimes caught in this way. Should one be hooked too large
for the fisherman to manage, the man in the next boat comes to his
assistance, and receives a quarter of the fish for his trouble. This is
carried on all through the year, and the size of some of the Bagri is
enormous. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish are shot in various ways, by a Chittagong bamboo, which
is a hollow tube, down which the arrow is propelled by the
marksman&rsquo;s mouth. This mode is sometimes very remunerative, and
is followed by persons who quietly sneak along the shores, either of
sluggish streams or of the backwater. Sometimes they climb up into
trees, and there await a good shot. Or, during the monsoon, the
sportsman quietly seats himself near some narrow channel that passes
from one wide piece of water into another, and watches for his prey.
Other fishermen shoot with bows and arrows, and again others with
cross-bows, the iron arrow or bolt of which is attached by a line to
the bow, to prevent its being lost. But netting fish, catching them
with hooks, or shooting them with arrows, are not the only means
employed for their capture. Bamboo labyrinths, bamboo baskets, and even
men&rsquo;s hands alone, are called into use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Persons fish for crabs in shallow brackish water, provided
with baskets like those employed in Europe for catching eels, but open
at both ends. The fishermen walk about in the mud, and, when they feel
a fish move, endeavour to cover it with the larger end of the basket,
which is forced down some distance into the mud, and the hand is then
passed downward through the upper extremity, and the fish taken out.
Another plan of catching them by the hand is by having two lines to
which white cocoanut leaves are attached tied to the fisherman&rsquo;s
two great toes, from which they diverge; the other end of each being
held by another man a good way off, and some distance apart. On these
lines being shaken, the fish become frightened, and, strange as it may
appear, cluster for protection around the man&rsquo;s feet, who is able
to stoop down, and catch them with his hands, by watching his

<p>&ldquo;Bamboo labyrinths are common all along the backwater, in
which a good many fish, especially eels and crabs, are captured. These
labyrinths are formed of a screen of split bamboos, passing
perpendicularly out of the water, and leading into a larger baited
chamber. A dead cat is often employed as a bait for crabs. A string is
attached to its body, and, after it has been in the water some days, it
is pulled up with these crustacea adherent to it. Persons are often
surprised at crabs being considered unwholesome, but their astonishment
would cease, if they were aware what extremely unclean feeders they
are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish are obtained from the inland rivers by poisoning them,
but this can only be done when the water is low. A dam is thrown across
a certain portion, and the poison placed within it. It generally
consists of <i lang="la-x-bio">Cocculus indicus</i> (berries) pounded
with rice; croton oil seeds, etc.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Vallamban.</b>&mdash;The Vallambans are a small Tamil cultivating
class living in the Tanjore, Trichinopoly, and Madura districts. They
are said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4716src" href="#xd21e4716" name=
"xd21e4716src">16</a> to be &ldquo;the offspring of a Vell&#257;lan and
a Valaiya woman, now a small and insignificant caste of cultivators.
Some of them assert that their ancestors were the lords of the soil,
for whose sole benefit the Vell&#257;lans used to carry on cultivation.
Tradition makes the Vellambans to have joined the Kallans in attacking
and driving away the Vell&#257;lans. It is customary among the
Vallambans, when demising land, to refer to the fact of their being
descendants of the Vallambans who lost Vallam, <i>i.e.</i>, the Vallama
n&#257;du in Tanjore, their proper country.&rdquo; Some Vallambans
claim to be flesh-eating Vell&#257;las, or to be superior to Kallans
and Maravans by reason of their Vell&#257;la ancestry. They call
themselves Vallamt&#333;tta Vell&#257;las, or the Vell&#257;las who
lost Vallam, and say that they were Vell&#257;las of Vallam in the
Tanjore district, who left their native place in a time of famine.</p>
<p>Portions of the Madura and Tanjore districts are divided into areas
known as n&#257;dus, in each of which a certain caste, called the
N&#257;ttar, is the predominant factor. For example, the Vallambans and
Kallans are called the N&#257;ttars of the P&#257;laya n&#257;du in the
Sivaganga zemindari of the Madura district. In dealing with the tribal
affairs of the various castes inhabiting a particular n&#257;du, the
lead is taken by the N&#257;ttars, by whom certain privileges are
enjoyed, as for example in the distribution <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>to
them, after the Br&#257;hman and zamindar, of the flowers and sacred
ashes used in temple worship. For the purposes of caste council
meetings the Vallambans collect together representatives from fourteen
n&#257;dus, as they consider that the council should be composed of
delegates from a head village and its branches, generally thirteen in
number.</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. F. R. Hemingway that the Vallambans &ldquo;speak
of five sub-divisions, namely, Chenjin&#257;du, Amaravatin&#257;du,
Palayan&#257;du, M&#275;ln&#257;du, and Kiln&#257;du. The M&#275;l and
Kiln&#257;du people intermarry, but are distinguishable by the fact
that the former have moustaches, and the latter have not. The women
dress like the N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai Chettis. Tattooing is not allowed,
and those who practice it are expelled from the caste. The men
generally have no title, but some who enjoy State service inams call
themselves Ambalak&#257;ran. The M&#275;ln&#257;du people have no
exogamous divisions, though they observe the rule about K&#333;vil
Pang&#333;lis. The Kiln&#257;dus have exogamous kilais, karais, and
pattams.&rdquo; As examples of exogamous septs, the following may be
cited:&mdash;S&#333;langal (Ch&#333;la), P&#257;ndiangal
(P&#257;ndyan), Nariangal (jackal), and Piliyangal (tiger).</p>
<p>The headman of the Vallambans is referred to generally as the
Servaik&#257;ran. The headman of a group of n&#257;dus is entitled
N&#257;ttuservai, while the headman of a village is known as &#362;r
Servai, or simply Servai.</p>
<p>Marriage is celebrated between adults, and the remarriage of widows
is not objected to. It is stated<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4732src"
href="#xd21e4732" name="xd21e4732src">17</a> that &ldquo;the maternal
uncle&rsquo;s or paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter is claimed as a matter
of right by a boy, so that a boy of ten may be wedded to a mature woman
of twenty or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>twenty-five years, if she happens to be
unmarried and without issue. Any elderly male member of the boy&rsquo;s
family&mdash;his elder brother, uncle, or even his father&mdash;will
have intercourse with her, and beget children, which the boy, when he
comes of age, will accept as his own, and legitimatise.&rdquo; This
system of marriage, in which there is a marked disparity in the ages of
the contracting couple, is referred to in the proverb: &ldquo;The
t&#257;li should be tied at least by a log of wood.&rdquo; The marriage
rites are as a rule non-Br&#257;hmanical, but in some well-to-do
families the services of a Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit are enlisted. The
presence of the Umbalak&#257;ran or caste headman at a marriage is
essential. On the wedding day the contracting couple offer, at their
homes, manaipongal (boiled rice), and the alangu ceremony is performed
by waving coloured rice round them, or touching the knees, shoulders,
and head with cakes, and throwing them over the head. The
wrist-threads, consisting of a piece of old cloth dyed with turmeric,
are tied on by the maternal uncle. Cooked rice and vegetables are
placed in front of the marriage dais, and offered to the gods. Four
betel leaves are given to the bridegroom, who goes round the dais, and
salutes the four cardinal points of the compass by pouring water from a
leaf. He then sits down on a plank on the dais, and hands the t&#257;li
(marriage badge) to his sister. Taking the t&#257;li, she proceeds to
the bride&rsquo;s house, where the bride, after performing the alangu
ceremony, is awaiting her arrival. On reaching the house, she asks for
the bride&rsquo;s presents, and one of her brothers replies that such a
piece of land, naming one, is given as a dowry. The bridegroom&rsquo;s
sister then removes the string of black and gold beads, such as is worn
before marriage, from the bride&rsquo;s neck, and replaces it by the
t&#257;li. The conch shell should be blown by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>women or children during the performance of
manaipongal, and when the t&#257;li is tied. The bride is conveyed to
the house of the bridegroom, and sits with him on the dais while the
relations make presents to them.</p>
<p>The messenger who conveys the news of a death in the community is a
Paraiyan. The corpse is placed within a pandal (booth) supported on
four posts, which is erected in front of the house. Some paddy
(unhusked rice) is poured from a winnow on to the ground, and rice is
thrown over the face of the corpse. On the second day rice, and other
articles of food, are carried by a barber to the spot where the corpse
has been buried or burnt. If the latter course has been adopted, the
barber picks out some of the remains of the bones, and hands them to
the son of the deceased. On the third day, the widow goes round the
pandal three times, and, entering within it, removes her t&#257;li
string, and new clothes are thrown over her neck. On the sixteenth day
the final death ceremonies (karm&#257;ndhiram) are performed. A feast
is given, and new cloths are tied on the heads of those under
pollution. Pollution lasts for thirty days.</p>
<p>The Vallambans profess to be Saivaites, but they consider Periya
N&#257;yaki of V&#275;langkudi as their tribal goddess, and each
n&#257;du has its own special deity, such as V&#275;mbu Aiyanar,
Nelliyandi Aiyanar, etc. In some places the tribal deity is worshipped
on a Tuesday at a festival called Sevvai (Tuesday). On this day pots
containing fermented rice liquor, which must have been made by the
caste people and not purchased, are taken to the place of worship. On a
Friday, those families which are to take part in the festival allow a
quantity of paddy (rice) to germinate by soaking it in water, and on
the following Tuesday flower spikes of the palmyra palm are added to
the malted rice liquor in the pots. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>pots of ordinary
families may be placed in their houses, but those of the
Umbalak&#257;rans and Servaik&#257;rans must be taken to the temple as
representing the deity. Into these pots the flower spikes should be
placed by some respected elder of the community. A week later, a small
quantity of rice liquor is poured into other pots, which are carried by
women to the temple car, round which they go three times. They then
throw the liquor into a tank or pond. The pots of the Umbalak&#257;ran
and Servaik&#257;ran must be carried by young virgins, or grown-up
women who are not under menstrual pollution. One of the women who
carries these pots usually becomes possessed by the village deity. At
the time of the festival, cradles, horses, human figures, elephants,
etc., made by the potter, are brought to the temple as votive offerings
to the god.</p>

Valluvan&#257;d belongs.</p>
<p><b>Valluvan.</b>&mdash;The Valluvans are summed up by Mr. H. A.
Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4757src" href="#xd21e4757" name=
"xd21e4757src">18</a> as being &ldquo;the priests of the Paraiyans and
Pallans. Tiruvalluvar, the famous Tamil poet, author of the Kur&#257;l,
belonged to this caste, which is usually regarded as a sub-division of
Paraiyans. It appears that the Valluvans were priests to the Pallava
kings before the introduction of the Br&#257;hmans, and even for some
time after it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4760src" href="#xd21e4760"
name="xd21e4760src">19</a> In an unpublished Vatteluttu <span class=

century, the following sentence occurs &lsquo;Sri Velluvam
P&#363;vanavan, the Uvac&rsquo;chan (&#332;c&rsquo;chan) of this
temple, will employ daily six men for doing the temple service.&rsquo;
Again, the Valluvans must have formerly held a position at least equal
to that of the Vell&#257;las, if the story that Tiruvalluva
N&#257;yanar married a Vell&#257;la girl is true.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4767src" href="#xd21e4767" name="xd21e4767src">20</a> He is said
to have &ldquo;refused to acknowledge the distinctions of caste, and
succeeded in obtaining a Vell&#257;la woman as his wife, from whom a
section of the Valluvans say it has its descent. As their ancestor
amused himself in the intervals between his studies by weaving, they
employ themselves in mending torn linen, but chiefly live by astrology,
and by acting as priests of Paraiyans, and officiating at their
funerals and marriages, though some refuse to take part in the former
inauspicious ceremony, and leave the duty to those whom they consider
impure Valluvans called Paraiya T&#257;das. Another section of the
Valluvans is called &#256;lvar D&#257;sari or T&#257;vadadh&#257;ri
(those who wear the necklace of tulsi beads). Both Saivites and
Vaishnavites eat together, but do not intermarry. Unlike Paraiyans,
they forbid remarriage of widows and even polygamy, and all males above
twelve wear the sacred thread.&rdquo; According to one account, the
Valluvans are the descendants of an alliance between a Br&#257;hman
sage and a Paraiyan woman, whose children complained to their father of
their lowly position. He blessed them, and told them that they would
become very clever astrologers, and, in consequence, much respected. At
the Travancore census, 1901, the Valluvans were defined as a
sub-division of the Pulayas, for whom they perform priestly functions.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=

<p>&ldquo;Both men and women are employed as astrologers and doctors,
and are often consulted by all classes of people. In many villages they
have the privilege of receiving from each ryot a handful of grain
during the harvest time.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4775src"
href="#xd21e4775" name="xd21e4775src">21</a> Of three Valluvans, whom I
interviewed at Coimbatore, one, with a flowing white beard, had a
lingam wrapped up in a pink cloth round the neck, and a charm tied in a
pink cloth round the right upper arm. Another, with a black beard, had
a salmon-coloured turban. The third was wearing a discarded British
soldier&rsquo;s tunic. All wore necklaces of r&#363;dr&#257;ksha
(<i lang="la-x-bio">El&aelig;ocarpus Ganitrus</i>) beads, and their
foreheads were smeared with oblong patches of sandal paste. Each of
them had a collection of panchangams, or calendars for determining
auspicious dates, and a bundle of palm leaf strips (ulla mudyan)
inscribed with sl&#333;kas for astrological purposes. Their
professional duties included writing charms for sick people, preparing
horoscopes, and making forecasts of good or evil by means of cabalistic
squares marked on the ground. Some Valluvans would have us believe that
those who officiate as priests are not true Valluvans, and that the
true Valluvan, who carries out the duties of an astrologer, will not
perform priestly functions for the Paraiyans.</p>

</div>
<p>The most important sub-divisions of the Valluvans, returned at times
of census, are Paraiyan, T&#257;vidad&#257;ri, and Tiruvalluvan. From
information supplied to me, I gather that there are two main divisions,
called Arupathu Katchi (sixty house section) and Narpathu Katchi (forty
house section). The former are supposed to be descendants of Nandi
Gurukkal, and take his name <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href=
"#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>as their g&#333;tra. The
g&#333;tra of the latter is Sidambara Sayichya Ayyamgar. Sidambara, or
Chidambaram, is the site of one of the most sacred Siva temples. The
sub-division &#256;lv&#257;r claims descent from Tirupp&#257;n
&#256;lv&#257;r, one of the twelve Vaishnava saints. In the Tanjore
district, the Valluvans have exogamous septs or pattaperu, named after
persons, <i>e.g.</i>, Marulipichan, Govindazhvan, etc.</p>
<p>The Valluvans include in their ranks both Vaishnavites and Saivites.
The majority of the latter, both males and females, wear the lingam.
The affairs of the community are adjusted by a caste council and there
are, in most places, two hereditary officers called K&#333;lkaran and
Kanakkan.</p>
<p>At the betrothal ceremony the bride&rsquo;s money (pariyam), betel,
jewels, flowers, and fruit, are placed in the future bride&rsquo;s lap.
The money ranges from seven to ten rupees if the bridegroom&rsquo;s
village is on the same side of a river as the bride&rsquo;s, and from
ten to twenty rupees if it is on the other side. A small sum of money,
called uramurai kattu (money paid to relations) and panda varisai
(money paid in the pandal), is also paid by the bridegroom&rsquo;s
party for a feast of toddy to the relations. This is the proper time
for settling caste disputes by the village council. On the wedding day,
the milk-post, consisting of a green bamboo pole, is set up, and a
number of pots, brought from the potter&rsquo;s house, are placed near
it. On the dais are set four lamps, viz., an ordinary brass lamp,
kudavilakku (pot light), alank&#257;ra vilakku (ornamental light), and
p&#257;ligai vilakku (seedling light). The bride and bridegroom bring
some sand, spread it on the floor near the dais, and place seven leaves
on it. Cotton threads, dyed with turmeric, are tied to the pots and the
milk-post. On the leaves are set cakes and rice, and the contracting
couple worship <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>the pots and the family gods. The Valluvan
priest repeats a jumble of corrupt Sanskrit, and ties the kankanams
(threads) on their wrists. They are then led into the house, and
garlanded with jasmine or <i>Nerium</i> flowers. The pots are arranged
on the dais, and the sand is spread thereon close to the milk-post.
Into one of the pots the female relations put grain seedlings, and four
other pots are filled with water by the bridegroom&rsquo;s party. A
small quantity of the seedlings is usually wrapped up in a cloth, and
placed over the seedling pot. Next morning the bundle is untied, and
examined, to see if the seedlings are in good condition. If they are
so, the bride is considered a worthy one; if not, the bride is either
bad, or will die prematurely. The usual nalagu ceremony is next
performed, bride and bridegroom being anointed with oil, and smeared
with <i lang="la-x-bio">Phaseolus Mungo</i> paste. This is followed by
the offering of food on eleven leaves to the ancestors and house gods.
Towards evening, the dais is got ready for its occupation by the bridal
couple, two planks being placed on it, and covered with cloths lent by
a washerman. The couple, sitting on the planks, exchange betel and
paddy nine or twelve times, and rice twenty-seven times. The priest
kindles the sacred fire (h&#333;mam), and pours some gh&#299;
(clarified butter) into it from a mango leaf. The bridegroom is asked
whether he sees Arundati (the pole-star) thrice, and replies in the
affirmative. The t&#257;li is shown the sky, smoked over burning
camphor, and placed on a tray together with a rupee. After being
blessed by those present, it is tied round the neck of the bride by the
bridegroom, who has his right leg on her lap. On the second day there
is a procession through the village, and, on the following day, the
wrist-threads are removed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href=
"#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span></p>
<p>In some places, the Valluvans, at their marriages, like the Pallis
and some other castes, use the pandamutti, or pile of pots reaching to
the top of the pandal.</p>
<p>The Saivite lingam wearers bury their dead in a sitting posture in a
niche excavated in the side of the grave. After death has set in, a
cocoanut is broken, and camphor burnt. The corpse is washed by
relations, who bring nine pots of water for the purpose. The lingam is
tied on to the head, and a cloth bundle, containing a rupee, seven
bilva (<i lang="la-x-bio">&AElig;gle Marmelos</i>) leaves, nine twigs
of the tulsi (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ocimum sanctum</i>), and nine <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Leucas aspera</i> flowers, to the right arm. The corpse is
carried to the grave on a car surmounted by five brass vessels. The
grave is purified by the sprinkling of cow&rsquo;s urine and cow-dung
water before the corpse is lowered into it. On the way to the
burial-ground, the priest keeps on chanting various songs, such as
&ldquo;This is Kail&#257;sa. This is Kail&#257;sa thillai
(Chidambaram). Our request is this. Nallia Mutthan of the Nandidarma
g&#333;tra died on Thursday in the month Thai in the year Subakruthu.
He must enter the fourth stage (sayichyam), passing through
S&#257;lokam, S&#257;m&#299;pa, and S&#257;rupa. He crosses the rivers
of stones, of thorns, of fire, and of snakes, holding the tail of the
bull Nandi. To enable him to reach heaven safely, we pound rice, and
put lights of rice.&rdquo; The priest receives a fee for his services,
which he places before an image made on the grave after it has been
filled in. The money is usually spent in making a sacred bull, lingam,
or stone slab, to place on the grave. On the third day after death, the
female relatives of the deceased pour milk within the house into a
vessel, which is taken by the male relatives to the burial-ground, and
offered at the grave, which is cleaned. A small platform, made of mud,
and composed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>of several tiers, decreasing in size from below
upwards, is erected thereon, and surmounted by a lingam. At the north
and south corners of this platform, a bull and parad&#275;si
(mendicant) made of mud are placed, and at each corner leaves are laid,
on which the offerings in the form of rice, fruits, vegetables, etc.,
are laid. The final death ceremonies are celebrated on the seventeenth
day. A pandal (booth) is set up, and closed in with cloths. Within it
are placed a pot and five pestles and mortars, to which threads are
tied. Five married women, taking hold of the pestles, pound some rice
contained in the pot, and with the flour make a lamp, which is placed
on a tray. The eldest son of the deceased goes, with the lamp on his
head, to an enclosure having an entrance at the four cardinal points.
The enclosure is either a permanent one with mud walls, or temporary
one made out of mats. Within the enclosure, five pots are set up in the
centre, and four at each side. The pots are cleansed by washing them
with the urine of cows of five different colours, red, white, black,
grey, and spotted. Near the pots the articles required for p&#363;ja
(worship) are placed, and the officiating priest sits near them. The
enclosure is supposed to represent heaven, and the entrances are the
gates leading thereto, before which food is placed on leaves. The
eldest son, with the lamp, stands at the eastern entrance, while Siva
is worshipped. The priest then repeats certain stanzas, of which the
following is the substance. &ldquo;You who come like Siddars
(attendants in the abode of Siva) at midnight, muttering Siva&rsquo;s
name, why do you come near Sivapadam? I will pierce you with my
trident. Get away. Let these be taken to yamapuri, or hell.&rdquo; Then
Siva and Parvati, hearing the noise, ask &ldquo;Oh! sons, who are you
that keep on saying Hara, Hara? Give out truly your names and
nativity.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310"
name="pb310">310</a>]</span>To which the reply is given &ldquo;Oh!
Lord, I am a devotee of that Being who graced Markandeya, and am a
V&#299;rasaiva by faith. I have come to enter heaven. We have all led
pure lives, and have performed acts of charity. So it is not just that
we should be prevented from entering. Men who ill-treat their parents,
or superiors, those addicted to all kinds of vice, blasphemers,
murderers, perverts from their own faith and priests, and other such
people, are driven to hell by the southern gate.&rdquo; At this stage,
a thread is passed round the enclosure. The son, still bearing the
lamp, goes from the eastern entrance past the south and western
entrances, and, breaking the thread, goes into the enclosure through
the northern entrance. The Nandik&#333;l (hereditary village official)
then ties a cloth first round the head of the eldest son, and
afterwards round the heads of the other sons and agnates.</p>
<p>The Valluvans abstain from eating beef. Though they mix freely with
the Paraiyans, they will not eat with them, and never live in the
Paraiyan quarter.</p>

Pand&#257;ram. In some places, the priests of the Valluvans are

<p><b>V&#257;l Nambi.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census Report,
1901, as &ldquo;a synonym for M&#363;ssad. Nambi is a title of
Br&#257;hmans, and v&#257;l means a sword. The tradition is that the
name arose from the ancestors of the caste having lost some of the
privileges of the V&#275;dic Br&#257;hmans owing to their having served
as soldiers when Malabar was ruled by the Br&#257;hmans prior to the
days of the Perum&#257;ls.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Valuv&#257;di.</b>&mdash;The Valuv&#257;dis are returned, in the
Madras Census Report, 1901, as cultivators in the Puduk&#333;ttai
State. I am informed that the Valuv&#257;dis are a section of the
Valaiyan caste, to which the Zamindar of Nagaram belongs. The name
Valuv&#257;di was originally a title of respect, appended to the name
of the Nagaram Zamindars. The name of the present Zamindar is
Balasubramanya Valuv&#257;diar. Thirty years ago there is said to have
been no Valuv&#257;di caste. Some Valaiyans in prosperous
circumstances, and others who became relatives of the Nagaram Zamindar
by marriage, have changed their caste name, to show that they are
superior in social status to the rest of the community.</p>
<p><b>Vamme.</b>&mdash;A g&#333;tra of Janappans, the members of which

oil-pressers; they are in reality traders. They are said to have come
from Goa, and they speak Konkani. Their spiritual guru is the head of
the Kumbak&#333;nam math.&rdquo; In the Census Report, 1901, it is
noted that V&#257;ni, meaning literally a trader, is a Konkani-speaking
trading caste, of which B&#257;nd&#275;kara is a synonym. &ldquo;They
ape the Br&#257;hmanical customs, and call themselves by the curious
hybrid name of Vaisya Br&#257;hmans.&rdquo; Hari Chetti has been

<p><b>V&#257;niyan.</b>&mdash;The V&#257;niyans are, Mr. Francis
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4882src" href="#xd21e4882" name=
"xd21e4882src">24</a> &ldquo;oil-pressers among the Tamils,
corresponding to the Telugu G&#257;ndlas, Canarese G&#257;nigas,
Malabar Chakk&#257;ns, and Oriya Tellis. For some obscure reason, Manu
classed oil-pressing as a base occupation, and all followers of the
calling are held in small esteem, and, in Tinnevelly, they are not
allowed to enter the temples. In consequence, however, of their
services in lighting the temples (in token of which all of them, except
the Malabar V&#257;niyans and Chakk&#257;ns, wear the sacred thread),
they are earning a high position, and some of them use the sonorous
title of J&#333;ti Nagaratt&#257;r (dwellers in the city of light) and
Tiru-vilakku Nagaratt&#257;r (dwellers in the city of holy lamps). They
employ Br&#257;hmans as priests, practice infant marriage, and prohibit
widow marriage, usually burn their dead, and decline to eat in the
houses of any caste below Br&#257;hmans. However, even the washermen
decline to eat with them. Like the G&#257;ndlas they have two
sub-divisions, Ottai-sekk&#257;n and Irattai-sekk&#257;n, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>who
use respectively one bullock and two bullocks in their mills. Oddly
enough, the former belong to the right-hand faction, and the latter to
the left. Their usual title is Chetti. The name V&#257;nuvan has been
assumed by V&#257;niyans, who have left their traditional occupation,
and taken to the grain and other trades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word V&#257;nijyam,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart informs
us,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4889src" href="#xd21e4889" name=
"xd21e4889src">25</a> &ldquo;signifies trade, and trade in oil, as well
as its manufacture, is the usual employment of this caste, who assert
that they are Vaisyas, and claim the Vaisya-Apur&#257;nam as their holy
book. They are said to have assumed the thread only within the last
fifty or sixty years, and are reputed to be the result of a y&#257;gam
(sacrifice by fire) performed by a saint called Vakkuna Mah&#257;rishi.
The caste contains four sub-divisions called K&#257;m&#257;kshiamma,
Vis&#257;l&#257;kshiamma, Ac&rsquo;chu-t&#257;li, and Toppa-t&#257;li,
the two first referring to the goddesses principally worshipped by
each, and the two last to the peculiar kinds of t&#257;lis, or marriage
tokens, worn by their women. They have the same customs as the
B&#275;ri Chettis, but are not particular in observing the rule which
forbids the eating of flesh. A bastard branch of the V&#257;niyas is
called the Pillai K&#363;ttam, which is said to have sprung from the
concubine of a V&#257;niyan, who lived many years ago. The members of
this class are never found except where V&#257;niyans live, and are
supposed to have a right to be fed and clothed by them. Should this be
refused, they utter the most terrible curse, and, in this manner,
eventually intimidate the uncharitable into giving them alms.&rdquo; In
the Census Report, 1891, Mr. Stuart writes further that the
V&#257;niyans &ldquo;were formerly called Sekk&#257;n (oil-mill man),
and it is curious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314"
name="pb314">314</a>]</span>that the oil-mongers alone came to be
called V&#257;niyan or trader. They have returned 126 sub-divisions, of
which only one, Ilai V&#257;niyan, is numerically important. One
sub-division is Iranderudu, or two bullocks, which refers to the use of
two bullocks in working the mill. This separation of those who use two
bullocks from those who employ only one is found in nearly every
oil-pressing caste in India. The V&#257;niyans of Malabar resemble the
N&#257;yars in their customs and habits, and neither wear the sacred
thread, nor employ Br&#257;hmans as priests. In North Malabar,
N&#257;yars are polluted by their touch, but in the south, where they
are called Vattak&#257;dans, they have succeeded in forcing themselves
into the ranks of the N&#257;yar community. A large number of them
returned N&#257;yar as their main caste.&rdquo; In this connection, Mr.
Francis states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4894src" href="#xd21e4894"
name="xd21e4894src">26</a> that followers of the calling of
oil-pressers (Chakk&#257;ns) are &ldquo;known as Vattak&#257;dans in
South Malabar, and as V&#257;niyans in North Malabar; but the former
are the higher in social status, the N&#257;yars being polluted by the
touch of the V&#257;niyans and Chakk&#257;ns but not by that of the
Vattak&#257;dans. Chakk&#257;ns and V&#257;niyans may not enter
Br&#257;hman temples. Their customs and manners are similar to those of
the N&#257;yars, who will not, however, marry their women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the V&#257;niyans of Cochin, it is stated in the Cochin Census
Report, 1901, that &ldquo;they are Vaisyas, and wear the sacred thread.
In regard to marriage, inheritance, ceremonies, dress, ornaments, etc.,
there is practically no difference between them and the Konkanis. But,
as they do not altogether abstain from meat and spirituous liquors,
they are not allowed free access to the houses of Konkanis, nor are
they permitted to touch their tanks <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>and wells. They are
Saivites. They have their own priests, who are called Panditars. They
observe birth and death pollution for ten days, and are like
Br&#257;hmans in this respect. They are mostly petty merchants and
shop-keepers. Some can read and write Malay&#257;lam, but they are very
backward in English education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The oils expressed by the V&#257;niyans are said to be
&ldquo;gingelly (<i lang="la-x-bio">Sesamum indicum</i>), cocoanut,
iluppei (<i lang="la-x-bio">Bassia longifolia</i>), pinnei (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Calophyllum inophyllum</i>), and ground-nut (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Arachis hypog&aelig;a</i>). According to the s&#257;stras
the crushing of gingelly seeds, and the sale of gingelly oil, are
sinful acts, and no one, who does not belong to the V&#257;niyan class,
will either express or sell gingelly oil.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p><b>Vann&#257;n.</b>&mdash;The Vann&#257;ns are washermen in the
Tamil and Malayal&#257;m countries. The name Vann&#257;n is, Mr. H. A.
Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4942src" href="#xd21e4942"
name="xd21e4942src">28</a> &ldquo;derived from vannam, beauty. There is
a tradition that they are descendants of the mythological hero
V&#299;rabadra, who was ordered by Siva to wash the clothes of all men,
as an expiation of the sin of putting many people to death in
Daksha&rsquo;s Y&#257;ga. Hence the Tamil washermen are frequently
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>called V&#299;rabadran. Having to purify all the
filthy linen of the villagers, they are naturally regarded as a low,
unclean class of S&#363;dras, and are always poor. They add to their
income by hiring out the clothes of their customers to funeral parties,
who lay them on the ground before the pall-bearers, so that these may
not step upon the ground, and by letting them out on the sly to persons
wishing to use them without having to purchase for themselves. In
social standing the Vann&#257;ns are placed next below the barbers.
They profess to be Saivites in the southern districts, and Vaishnavites
in the north. The marriage of girls generally takes place after
puberty. Widow remarriage is permitted among some, if not all,
sub-divisions. Divorce may be obtained by either party at pleasure on
payment of double the bride-price, which is usually Rs.
10&ndash;8&ndash;0. They are flesh-eaters, and drink liquor. The dead
are either burned or buried. The Pothara (or Podora) Vann&#257;ns are
of inferior status, because they wash only for Paraiyans, Pallans, and
other inferior castes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted, in the Madura Manual, that those who have seen the
abominable substances, which it is the lot of the Vann&#257;ns to make
clean, cannot feel any surprise at the contempt with which their
occupation is regarded. In the Tanjore Manual, it is recorded that, in
the rural parts of the district, the Vann&#257;ns are not allowed to
enter the house of a Br&#257;hman or a Vell&#257;la; clothes washed by
them not being worn or mixed up with other clothes in the house until
they have undergone another wash by a caste man.</p>
<p>It is on record that, on one occasion, a party of Europeans, when
out shooting, met a funeral procession on its way to the burial-ground.
The bier was draped in many folds of clean cloth, which one of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span>party recognised by the initials as one of his
bed-sheets. Another identified as his sheet the cloth on which the
corpse was lying. He cut off the corner with the initials, and a few
days later the sheet was returned by the washerman, who pretended
ignorance of the mutilation, and gave as an explanation that it must
have been done, in his absence, by one of his assistants. On another
occasion, a European met an Eurasian, in a village not far from his
bungalow, wearing a suit of clothes exactly similar to his own, and, on
close examination, found they were his. They had been newly washed and
dressed.</p>
<p>The most important divisions numerically returned by Vann&#257;ns at
times of census are P&#257;ndiyan, Peru (big), Tamil, and Vaduga
(<span class="corr" id="xd21e4955" title=
"Source: notherner">northerner</span>). It is recorded, in the
Gazetteer of the Madura district, that Vann&#257;n &ldquo;is rather an
occupational term than a caste title, and, besides the P&#257;ndya
Vann&#257;ns or Vann&#257;ns proper, includes the Vaduga Vann&#257;ns
or Ts&#257;kalas of the Telugu country, and the Palla, Pudara, and
Tulukka Vann&#257;ns, who wash for the Pallans, Paraiyans, and
Musalmans respectively. The P&#257;ndya Vann&#257;ns have a headman
called the Periya Manishan (big man). A man can claim the hand of his
paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter. At weddings, the bridegroom&rsquo;s
sister ties the t&#257;li (marriage badge). Nambis officiate. Divorce
is freely allowed to either party on payment of twice the bride-price,
and divorc&eacute;es may marry again. The caste god is Gurun&#257;than,
in whose temples the p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest) is usually a
Vann&#257;n. The dead are generally burnt, and, on the sixteenth day,
the house is purified from pollution by a Nambi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some Vann&#257;ns have assumed the name Irkuli Vell&#257;la, and
R&#257;jakan and K&#257;ttavar&#257;ya vamsam have also been recorded
as synonyms of the caste name. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318"
href="#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Vann&#257;ns of Malabar are also called Mann&#257;n or
Bann&#257;n. They are, Mr. Francis writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4963src" href="#xd21e4963" name="xd21e4963src">29</a> &ldquo;a
low class of Malabar washermen, who wash only for the polluting castes,
and for the higher castes when they are under pollution following
births, deaths, etc. It is believed by the higher castes that such
pollution can only be removed by wearing clothes washed by
Mann&#257;ns, though at other times these cause pollution to them. The
washing is generally done by the women, and the men are exorcists,
devil-dancers and physicians, even to the higher castes. Their women
are midwives, like those of the Velakkatalavan and V&#275;lan castes.
This caste should not be confused with the Mann&#257;n hill tribe of
Travancore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of Malabar, that &ldquo;the
Mann&#257;ns, a makkatt&#257;yam caste of South Malabar, apparently
identical with the marumakkatt&#257;yam Vann&#257;ns of the north, are
a caste of washermen; and their services are indispensable to the
higher castes in certain purificatory ceremonies when they have to
present clean cloths (m&#257;ttu). They are also devil-dancers and
tailors. They practice fraternal polyandry in the south. Mann&#257;ns
are divided into two endogamous classes, Peru-mann&#257;ns (peru,
great), and Tinda-mann&#257;ns (tinda, pollution); and, in
Walavan&#257;d, into four endogamous classes called Ch&#333;ppan,
Peru-mann&#257;n, Punnek&#257;dan, and Puliyakk&#333;dam. The
Tinda-mann&#257;n and Puliyakk&#333;dam divisions perform the
purificatory sprinklings for the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The services of the Mann&#257;n, Mr. T. K. Gopal Panikkar
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4970src" href="#xd21e4970" name=
"xd21e4970src">30</a> &ldquo;are in requisition at the N&#257;yar
Thirandukali&#257;nam ceremonies on the attainment of puberty by a
girl, when they sing ballads, and have to bring, for the girl&rsquo;s
use, the m&#257;ttu or sacred dress. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb319" href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>Then, on occasions of
death pollution, they have a similar duty to perform. Among the
N&#257;yars, on the fourth, or rarely the third day after the menses,
the woman has to use, during her bath, clothes supplied by Mann&#257;n
females. The same duty they have to perform during the confinement of
N&#257;yar females. All the dirty cloths and bed sheets used, these
Mann&#257;n females have to wash.&rdquo; Mr. S. Appadorai Iyer informs
us that those Mann&#257;ns who are employed by the Kamm&#257;lan, or
artisan class, as barbers, are not admitted into the Mann&#257;n caste,
which follows the more honourable profession of washing clothes. The
Mann&#257;ns perform certain ceremonies in connection with Mundian, the
deity who is responsible for the weal or woe of cattle; and, at
P&#363;ram festivals, carry the vengida koda or prosperity umbrella,
composed of many tiers of red, green, orange, black and white cloth,
supported on a long bamboo pole, before the goddess.</p>
<p>It is recorded by Bishop Whitehead<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4978src" href="#xd21e4978" name="xd21e4978src">31</a> that, in
various places in Malabar, there are temples in honour of Bhagavati, at
which the p&#363;j&#257;ris (priests) are of the Vann&#257;n caste.
&ldquo;There is an annual feast called gurusi tarpanam (giving to the
guru) about March, when the hot weather begins, and the people are at
leisure. Its object is to appease the wrath of the goddess. During the
festival, the p&#363;j&#257;ri sits in the courtyard outside the
temple, thickly garlanded with red flowers, and with red kunkuma marks
on his forehead. Goats and fowls are then brought to him by the
devotees, and he kills them with one blow of the large sacrificial
sword or chopper. It is thought auspicious for the head to be severed
at one blow, and, apparently, p&#363;j&#257;ris who are skilful in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=
"pb320">320</a>]</span>decapitation are much in request. When the head
is cut off, the p&#363;j&#257;ri takes the carcase, and holds it over a
large copper vessel partly filled with water, turmeric, kunkuma, and a
little rice, and lets the blood flow into it. When all the animals are
killed, the p&#363;j&#257;ri <span class="corr" id="xd21e4983" title=
"Source: bales">bails</span> out the blood and water on the ground,
uttering mantrams (sacred lines or verses) the while. The people stand
a little way off. When the vessel is nearly empty, the p&#363;j&#257;ri
turns it upside down as a sign that the ceremony is ended. During these
proceedings, a number of Vann&#257;ns, dressed in fantastic costumes,
dance three times round the temple. During the festival, processions
are held round the various houses, and special swords with a curved
hook at the end, called palli val (great or honourable sword), are
carried by the worshippers. These swords are worshipped during the
Dusserah festival in October, and, in some shrines, they form the only
emblem of the deity. The Tiyans have small shrines in their own gardens
sacred to the family deity, which may be Bhagavati, or some demon, or
the spirit of an ancestor. Once a year, Vann&#257;ns come dressed in
fancy costume, with crowns on their heads, and dance round the
courtyard to the sound of music and tom-toms, while a Tiyan priest
presents the family offerings, uncooked rice and young cocoanuts, with
camphor and incense, and then rice fried with sugar and gh&#299;
(clarified butter).&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an account of the Tiyans, Mr. Logan writes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4988src" href="#xd21e4988" name="xd21e4988src">32</a> that
&ldquo;this caste is much given to devil-charming, or devil-driving as
it is often called. The washermen (Vann&#257;n) are the high priests of
this superstition, and with chants, ringing cymbals, magic figures, and
waving lights, they drive out evil spirits from their votaries of this
caste at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>certain epochs in their married lives. One
ceremony in particular, called teyy&#257;ttam&mdash;a corrupt form of
D&#275;va and &#257;ttam, that is, playing at gods&mdash;takes place
occasionally in the fifth month of pregnancy. A leafy arbour is
constructed, and in front of it is placed a terrible figure of
Ch&#257;mundi, the queen of the demons, made of rice flour, turmeric
powder, and charcoal powder. A party of not less than eighteen
washermen is organized to represent the demons and
furies&mdash;Kuttich&#257;ttan (a mischievous imp), and many others. On
being invoked, these demons bound on to the stage in pairs, dance,
caper, jump, roar, fight, and drench each other with saffron (turmeric)
water. Their capers and exertions gradually work up their excitement,
until they are veritably possessed of the devil. At this juncture,
fowls and animals are sometimes thrown to them, to appease their fury.
These they attack with their teeth, and kill and tear as a tiger does
his prey. After about twenty minutes the convulsions cease, the demon
or spirit declares its pleasure, and, much fatigued, retires to give
place to others; and thus the whole night is spent, with much
tom-tomming and noise and shouting, making it impossible, for Europeans
at least, to sleep within earshot of the din.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>V&#257;riyar.</b>&mdash;For the following note on the
V&#257;riyar section of the Ambalav&#257;sis, I am indebted to Mr. N.
Subramani Aiyar. The name is believed to be derived from Parasava,
which, according to Yajnavalkya and other law-givers, is the name given
to the son of a Br&#257;hman begotten on a S&#363;dra woman, and
suggests the fact that the V&#257;riyar is no Br&#257;hman, though the
blood of the latter may course through his veins, and though such
marriages were regarded as sacraments in early days. This is the
derivation given by Pachumuttalu in his
K&#275;ralavis&#275;sham&#257;h&#257;tmya, who adds that the chief
occupation of the V&#257;riyars is to sweep the floor of the temples.
In some of the Asauchavidhis (works on pollution) of K&#275;rala, the
commentator explains the word Parasava as V&#257;riya. Many
V&#257;riyars add the title Parasava to their name, when writing in
Sanskrit. Some derive the word from varija or one born of water, in
accordance with a tradition that Parasur&#257;ma created from water a
class of persons for special service in temples, and to take the place
of S&#363;dras, who, being meat-eaters, were ineligible for the same.
Others again, like the late Professor Sundaram Pillay, would take
V&#257;riyar as being derived from varuka, to sweep. Recently, some
ingenuity has been displayed in splitting the word into two words,
giving it a meaning equivalent to pseudo-Aryan. The title Asan, or
teacher, is possessed by certain families, whose members have held the
hereditary position of tutors in noblemen&rsquo;s houses. In
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>medi&aelig;val times, many V&#257;riyar families
received royal edicts, conferring upon them the privileges of being
tutors and astrologers. These special rights are even now possessed by
them.</p>
<p>The following legend is narrated concerning the origin of the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e5033" title=
"Source: V&#257;riars">V&#257;riyars</span>. A S&#363;dra woman removed
a bone from within a temple in obedience to the wish of certain
Br&#257;hman priests, and was excommunicated from her caste. The
priests, on hearing this, were anxious to better her condition, and
made her the progenitor of a class of Ambalav&#257;sis or temple
servants, who were afterwards known as V&#257;riyars. According to
another legend, the corpse of a M&#257;r&#257;n, which was found inside
a Namb&#363;tiri&rsquo;s house, was promptly removed by certain
N&#257;yars, who on that account were raised in the social scale, and
organised into a separate caste called V&#257;riyar. There is a still
further tradition that, in the Treta Yuga, a S&#363;dra woman had five
sons, the first of whom became the progenitor of the Tiyatunnis, and
the second that of V&#257;riyars. A fourth account is given in the
K&#275;ralamah&#257;tmya. A young Br&#257;hman girl was married to an
aged man. Not confident in unaided human effort, under circumstances
such as hers, she devoted a portion of her time daily to preparing
flower garlands for the deity of the nearest temple, and conceived. But
the Br&#257;hman welcomed the little stranger by getting the mother
thrown out of caste. Her garlands could no longer be accepted, but,
nothing daunted, she worked as usual, and made a mental offering of the
garlands she prepared, which, through an unseen agency, became visible
on the person of the deity. Though the people were struck with shame at
their unkind treatment of the innocent girl, they were not prepared to
take her back. The V&#257;riyan caste was accordingly constituted, and
her child was brought up by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href=
"#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>the Azhancheri Tambrakkal, and
accommodated in the padippura or out-house at the entrance gate. In the
P&#257;supata Tantra, the V&#257;riyars are called
Kail&#257;sav&#257;sins, or those who live in Kail&#257;s, as they are
supposed to be specially devoted to the worship of Siva. Kail&#257;sa
is the abode of Siva, whither the blessed go after death.</p>
<p>The V&#257;riyars of Travancore are divided into four groups, called
Onattukara, Venattukara, Ilayetattunad (or Ilayathu), and Tekkumkur.
The Venattukaras have the privilege of interdining with the
Onattukaras, and having their ceremonies performed by priests from that
group. But the ceremonies of the Onattukaras appear to be performed
without the Venattukaras being admitted into their midst. The third and
fourth groups take food in the houses of the first and second, though
the reverse seldom happens. The V&#257;riyars in British Malabar are
divided into several other groups.</p>
<p>The V&#257;riyars are generally well-read, especially in Sanskrit,
make excellent astrologers, and are also medical practitioners. A
V&#257;riyar&rsquo;s house is called variyam, as the
Pish&#257;rati&rsquo;s is known as pish&#257;ram.</p>
<p>Married women have the hair-knot on the left side of the head, like
N&#257;yar ladies. They cover the breast with a folded cloth, and never
wear a bodice or other innovations in the matter of dress. The marriage
ornament is called m&#257;tra, and is in the shape of a maddalam or
drum. Other neck ornaments are called entram and kuzhal. The todu, or
ornament of N&#257;yar women, is worn in the ear-lobes. Women mark
their foreheads, like Namb&#363;tiri ladies, with sandal paste.</p>
<p>The V&#257;riyars, Pushpakans, and Pish&#257;ratis, are said to
constitute the three original garland-making castes of Malabar,
appointed by Parasur&#257;ma. At the present day, in all the important
temples, except in South <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href=
"#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>Travancore, where Kurukkals
perform that function, garlands can only be prepared by one of these
castes. The technical occupation of a V&#257;riyar in a temple is
called kazhakam, which is probably derived from the Dravidian root
kazhaku, to cleanse. Kazhakam is of two kinds, viz., malakkazhakam or
garland-making service, and talikkazhakam or sweeping service, of which
the former is more dignified than the latter. Under the generic term
kazhakar are included making flower garlands for the temple, preparing
materials for the offering of food, sweeping the beli offering,
carrying lights and holding umbrellas when the god is carried in
procession, having the custody of the temple jewels, etc. The
V&#257;riyar is at the beck and call of the temple priest, and has to
do sundry little services from morning till evening. He is remunerated
with some of the cooked food, after it has been offered to the deity.
The V&#257;riyars are to Saivite temples what the Pish&#257;ratis are
to Vaishnavite temples. Their prayers are prominently addressed only to
Siva, but they also worship Vishnu, Subramanya, Sasta, Gan&#275;sa, and
Bhadrak&#257;li. Their chief amusement is the farce called
K&#363;ttapp&#257;thakam, the hero of which is one Vank&#257;la Nikkan,
and the heroine Naityar. An Ilayatu is the stage-manager, and a
Pish&#257;rati the actor. Parangotan is the buffoon, and M&#257;ppa his
wife. In the eighteenth century, a grand festival lasting over
twenty-eight days, called mamangam, was celebrated in British Malabar.
The above characters are represented as proceeding to this festival,
which came off once in twelve years on the Magha asterism in the month
of Magha, and is hence popularly called Mah&#257;magha.</p>
<p>The V&#257;riyar caste is governed in all matters by the
Namb&#363;tiri Brahmans, but they have their own priests. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>The
Ilayatus believe that they were the preceptors of all the
Ambalav&#257;si castes in former times, but were dislodged from that
position owing to most of them employing priests from among their own
caste men. Even at the present day, Ilayatus are known to express their
displeasure when they are asked to drink water from a
V&#257;riyar&rsquo;s well. As, however, consecrated water from the
Namb&#363;tiris is taken to a V&#257;riyar for its purification, they
entertain no scruples about cooking their food there, provided they
carry with them the aupasana fire.</p>
<p>Inheritance among the V&#257;riyars of Cochin and British Malabar is
in the female line (marumakkath&#257;yam). Among the V&#257;riyars of
Travancore, chiefly these belonging to the Onattukara section, a kind
of qualified makkath&#257;yam prevails, in accordance with which both
sons and daughters have an equal right to inherit ancestral property.
The eldest male member is entitled to the management of the estate in
all undivided families. Partition, however, is largely followed in
practice.</p>
<p>The t&#257;li-kettu ceremony of the V&#257;riyars generally takes
place before a girl reaches puberty, and, in the case of boys, after
the ceremony of Sivadiksha has been performed, that is between the
twelfth and sixteenth years. If the marriage is in the kudi-vaippu
form, or, in other words, if there is an intention on the part of both
parties to treat the marital alliance as permanent, no separate
sambandham need be celebrated afterwards; and, in all cases where
marriages are celebrated between members of the same section, the
kudi-vaippu form is in vogue. If a girl is unmarried when she reaches
puberty, she is not permitted to take part in any religious ceremonies,
or enter any temple until she is married. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>The first item of a
V&#257;riyar&rsquo;s marriage is ayani-unu, when the bridegroom, decked
in new clothes and ornaments, dines sumptuously with his relations. He
then goes in procession to the bride&rsquo;s house, and, after bathing,
puts on clothes touched by the bride. After this some prayers are
recited, and a sacrifice is offered. The bride is then brought to the
marriage hall, and, all the Br&#257;hmanical rites are strictly
observed. After sunset, some grass and a leopard&rsquo;s skin are
placed on the floor on which white cloth is spread. The bridegroom, who
is seated on the northern side, worships Ganapati, after which the
couple take their seats on the cloth bed spread on the floor. Lights
are then waved in front of them. This ceremony is known as
dikshavirikkuka. In the kudi-vaippu form of marriage, the bride is
taken to the house of the bridegroom, where the dikshavirippu is
observed. Otherwise the marital rite becomes a mere t&#257;li-kattu
ceremony, and the girl, when she comes of age, may receive clothes in
token of conjugal connection with another person. When the first
husband dies, clothes may be received from another V&#257;riyar, or a
Br&#257;hman, whose wife the woman becomes.</p>
<p>Most of the ceremonies observed by Malay&#257;li Br&#257;hmans are
also performed by the V&#257;riyars, the vratas and upanayana being
among those which are omitted. Sivadiksha, as already indicated, is
observed between the twelfth and sixteenth years. The festival lasts
for four days, though the religious rites are over on the first day. At
an auspicious hour, the priest and the V&#257;riyar youth put on the
tattu dress, or dress worn for ceremonial purposes, and worship a pot
full of water with incense and flowers, the contents of which are then
poured by the priest over the youth. The priest and a M&#257;r&#257;n
then perform the tonsure, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328"
href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span>youth bathes. Some
Namb&#363;tiris are then engaged to perform the purificatory rite,
after which the V&#257;riyar wears the tattu as well as an upper cloth,
marks his forehead with ashes and sandal paste, and decorates himself
with jewels, rudr&#257;ksha (<i lang="la-x-bio">El&aelig;ocarpus
Ganitrus</i>) beads, and flowers. Alms are received by the young
V&#257;riyar from his mother, and he takes seven steps in a northerly
direction which symbolise his pilgrimage to Benares. It is only after
the performance of this rite that the V&#257;riyar is believed to
become a grihastha (married person, as opposed to a bachelor). The
funeral rites of the caste have been elaborated in many places. Death
pollution lasts for twelve days, and the sanchayana (milk ceremony) is
observed on the seventh or ninth day. Anniversary ceremonies are
celebrated in memory of close relations, and others are propitiated by
the performance of sr&#257;dh, and the feeding of a V&#257;riyar on a
new-moon day.</p>
<p>In an account of a royal wedding in Travancore in 1906, I read that
&ldquo;a number of V&#257;riyars left the th&#275;varathu koikal, or
palace where worship is performed, for a compound (garden) close by to
bring an areca palm. It is supposed that they do this task under divine
inspiration and guidance. One man is given a small rod by the Potti or
priest in the palace, and, after receiving this, he dances forward,
followed by his comrades, and all wend their way to a compound about a
furlong away. On reaching the spot, they uproot a big areca palm
without the use of any implement of iron, and take it away to the
th&#275;varathu koikal without its touching the ground, to the
accompaniment of music. They then plant it in front of the portico, and
do some p&#363;ja (worship) after the manner of Br&#257;hmans. The
function is comparable to the dhwajarohanam, or hoisting of the flag
during temple utsavams. The <span class="corr" id="xd21e5068" title=
"Source: V&#257;riyans">V&#257;riyars</span> dance round <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>the
tree, singing songs, and performing p&#363;ja. A piece of white cloth
is tied to the top of the tree, to serve as a flag, and a lamp is
lighted, and placed at the foot of the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The V&#257;riyars are described, in the Gazetteer of Malabar, as
&ldquo;a caste whose traditional duty is to sweep the temple precincts
(v&#257;ruga). At the present day, some members of the caste are
important land-owners or petty chieftains, occupying a very high social
position. They generally follow the marumakkat&#257;yam principle, but
they have also a form of marriage called Kudivekkal similar to the
Brahman Sarvasvadh&#257;nam, by which the wife is adopted as a member
of the family into which she marries, and her children also belong to
it. The V&#257;riyar&rsquo;s names and ceremonies indicate Sivaite
proclivities, just as those of the Pish&#257;rodi are tinged with
Vishnavism. The V&#257;riyar&rsquo;s house is called a V&#257;riyam,
and his woman-folk Varassiars. This class is perhaps the most
progressive among the Ambalav&#257;sis, some of its members having
received a Western education and entered the learned
professions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Varugu Bhatta.</b>&mdash;A mendicant class, which begs from
Perikes.</p>
<p><b>Varuna.</b>&mdash;Some Pattanavan fishermen have adopted the name
of Varunakula Vell&#257;la or Varunakula Mudali after Varuna the god of
the waters.</p>
<p><b>Vasa</b> (new).&mdash;A sub-division of Kurubas, who are said to
weave only white blankets.</p>
<p><b>Vasishta.</b>&mdash;A Br&#257;hmanical g&#333;tra adopted by
Khatris and Toreyas. Vasishta, one of the seven great Rishis, was the
son of Mitra and Varuna, whose quarrels with Viswamitra are narrated in
the R&#257;mayana.</p>
<p><b>Vastra.</b>&mdash;One division of the Koragas is called Vastra,
meaning cloths such <span class="corr" id="xd21e5096" title=
"Not in source">as</span> are used as a shroud for a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=

charity, the wearing of new cloths by them being prohibited. Vastrala
(cloth) further occurs as an exogamous sept of the Karna S&#257;l&#275;
and D&#275;v&#257;nga weavers.</p>
<p><b>Vattak&#257;dan.</b>&mdash;Recorded as a sub-division of
N&#257;yar, the occupation of which is expressing oil, chiefly for use
in temples. Mr. F. Fawcett writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5105src"
href="#xd21e5105" name="xd21e5105src">33</a> that, in North Malabar, he
has frequently been told by N&#257;yars of the superior classes that
they do not admit the Vattak&#257;dans to be N&#257;yars. According to
them, the Vattak&#257;dans have adopted the honorary affix N&#257;yar
to their names quite recently. In the Madras Census Report, 1891,
Vattak&#257;dan is stated to be a synonym of V&#257;niyan; and in the
report, 1901, this name is said to mean a Native of Vattak&#257;d, and
to be given to the Chakk&#257;ns.</p>
<p><b>Vatt&#275;</b> (camel).&mdash;A g&#333;tra of Kurni.</p>
<p><b>V&#257;tti.</b>&mdash;V&#257;tti or V&#257;ttikurup has been
recorded at times of census as a sub-division of N&#257;yar, and a
synonym of K&#257;vutiyan and T&#333;lkollan. V&#257;tti is said to
mean one who prays for happiness.</p>
<p><b>Vayani.</b>&mdash;The Vayanis, Vayinis, Vaguniyans, or Pavinis,
are a section of M&#257;digas, the members of which play on a
single-stringed mandoline, and go about from village to village,
singing the praises of the village goddesses. Each Vayani has his
recognised beat. He plays a prominent part in the celebration of the
annual festival of the village goddess, and receives a sacred thread
(kappu), which is usually tied to his mandoline, before the
commencement of the festival. He regards himself as superior in social
position to ordinary M&#257;digas, with whom he will not marry. The
name Vayani is said to be a corruption of varnane, meaning to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>describe. In some localities, <i>e.g.</i>, the
Chingleput district, the Vayani enjoys mir&#257;si rights in connection
with land.</p>
<p><b>V&#275;dan.</b>&mdash;The V&#275;dans are described by Mr. H. A.
Stuart, in the North Arcot Manual, as having been &ldquo;formerly
hunters and soldiers, and it is this caste which furnished a
considerable and valuable contingent to the early Hindu kings, and
later to the armies of Hyder and Tippoo. They are supposed by some to
be the remnants of the earliest inhabitants of the peninsula, and
identical with the Veddahs of Ceylon. They are also called
V&#257;lm&#299;kulu, which means those who live on the products of
ant-hills (v&#257;lm&#299;kum).&rdquo; It is noted, in the Census
Report, 1891, that the two castes B&#275;dar (or B&#333;ya) and
V&#275;dan were, &ldquo;through a misapprehension of instructions,
treated as identical in the tabulation papers. The two words are, no
doubt, etymologically identical, the one being Canarese and the other
Tamil, but the castes are quite distinct.&rdquo; It may be noted that
the name V&#257;lm&#299;ka or V&#257;lm&#299;ki is assumed by the
B&#333;yas, who claim descent from V&#257;lm&#299;ki, the author of the
R&#257;mayana, who did penance for so long in one spot that a white-ant
hill grew up round him.</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1901, the V&#275;dans are described as
&ldquo;a Tamil-speaking labouring and hunting caste, the members of
which were formerly soldiers, and subsequently dacoits. The name means
a hunter, and is loosely applied to the Irulas in some places
(<i>e.g.</i>, Chingleput). There is some connection between the
V&#275;dans and Tamil V&#275;ttuvans, but its precise nature is not
clear. The V&#275;ttuvans now consider themselves superior to the
V&#275;dans, and are even taking to calling themselves V&#275;ttuva
Vell&#257;las. Marriage (among the V&#275;dans) is either infant or
adult. Widows may marry their late husband&rsquo;s brother or agnates.
Some employ Br&#257;hmans as priests. They either burn or bury their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>dead. They claim descent from Kannappa
N&#257;yanar, one of the sixty-three Saivite saints. Ambalak&#257;rans
also claim to be descended from Kannappa N&#257;yan&#257;r. In Tanjore,
the Valaiyans declare themselves to have a similar origin. The title of
the V&#275;dans is N&#257;yakkan.&rdquo; In the Madura Manual, the
V&#275;dans are described as a very low caste, who get their living in
the jungles. They are not numerous now. They appear to have been naked
savages not very long ago, and their civilisation is far from complete.
They are held in the greatest contempt by men of all classes. They are
described further, in the Coimbatore Manual, as &ldquo;a very degraded,
poor tribe, living by basket-making, snaring small game, and so on.
They speak a low Canarese, and are as simple as savage. The delight of
a party at the gift of a rupee is something curious.&rdquo; In the
Salem district some V&#275;dans are said<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5136src" href="#xd21e5136" name="xd21e5136src">34</a> to be
&ldquo;known by the caste name Tiruvalar, who are <span class="corr"
id="xd21e5139" title="Source: dintinguished">distinguished</span> as
the Kattukudugiraj&#257;ti, a name derived from a custom among them,
which authorises temporary matrimonial arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following story in connection with bears and V&#275;dans is
worthy of being placed on record. The bears are said to collect ripe
wood-apples (<i lang="la-x-bio">Feronia elephantum</i>) during the
season, and store them in the forest. After a small quantity has been
collected, they remove the rind of the fruits, and heap together all
the pulp. They then bring honey and petals of sweet-smelling flowers,
put them on the heap of pulp, and thresh them with their feet and with
sticks in their hands. When the whole has become a consistent mass,
they feed on it. The V&#275;dan, who knows the season, is said to drive
off the bears by shooting at them, and rob them of their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=

<p>The V&#275;dars of Travancore are summed up by the Rev. S.
Mateer<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5157src" href="#xd21e5157" name=
"xd21e5157src">35</a> as &ldquo;living in jungle clearings or working
in the rice fields, and formerly sold and bought as slaves. They have
to wander about in seasons of scarcity in search of wild yams, which
they boil and eat on the spot, and are thorough gluttons, eating all
they can get at any time, then suffering want for days. Polygamy is
common, as men are not required to provide for the support of their
wives. Some, who have been converted to Christianity, show wonderful
and rapid improvement in moral character, civilisation and
diligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following note on the Mala (hill) V&#275;dans of Travancore,
I am indebted to Mrs. J. W. Evans.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5162src"
href="#xd21e5162" name="xd21e5162src">36</a> &ldquo;They live in
wretched huts amid the rice-flats at the foot of the hills, and are
employed by farmers to guard the crops from the ravages of wild beasts.
The upper incisor teeth of both men and women are filed to a sharp
point, like crocodile&rsquo;s fangs. One ugly old man, Tiruv&#257;tiran
by name (the name of a star), had the four teeth very slightly filed.
On being pressed for the reason why he had not conformed to Mala
V&#275;dar fashion, he grinned, and said &lsquo;What beauty I was born
with is enough for me.&rsquo; Probably the operation had been more
painful than he could bear, or, may be, he could not afford to pay the
five betel leaves and areca nuts, which are the customary fee of the
filer. Any man may perform the operation. A curved bill-hook, with
serrated edge, is the instrument used. On being asked whether they had
any tradition about the custom of tooth-filing, they replied that it
was to distinguish their caste, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb334" href="#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span>god Ch&#257;ttan
would be angry if they neglected the custom. It may be noted that
tooth-filing is also practiced by the jungle K&#257;dirs (<i>q.v.</i>).
Both males and females wore a cotton loin-cloth, mellowed by wear and
weather to a subtle greenish hue. Red and blue necklaces, interstrung
with sections of the chank shell (<i lang="la-x-bio">Turbinella
rapa</i>) adorned the necks and chests. One woman was of special
interest. Her neck and breasts were literally concealed by a medley of
beads, shells, brass bells, and two common iron keys&mdash;these last,
she said, for ornament. Around her hips, over her cloth, hung several
rows of small bones of pig and s&#257;mbar (<i lang="la-x-bio">Cervus
unicolor</i>). The Mala V&#275;dans find these bones in the jungle. An
aged priest said that he used to perform devil-dancing, but was now too
stiff to dance, and had to labour like the younger men. The Mala
V&#275;dans apparently possess no temples or shrines, but Hindus permit
them to offer money at the Hindu shrines from a distance, at times of
sudden sickness or during other seasons of panic. Their god
Ch&#257;ttan, or S&#257;ttan, has no fixed abode, but, where the Mala
V&#275;dans are, there is he in the midst of them. They bury their dead
in a recumbent posture, near the hut of the deceased. The Mala
V&#275;dans practice the primitive method of kindling fire by the
friction of wood (also practiced by the K&#257;nakars), and, like the
K&#257;nakars, they eat the black monkey. Their implements are
bill-hooks, and bows and arrows. They weave grass baskets, which are
slung to their girdles, and contain betel, etc.&rdquo;</p>

examined by myself were&mdash;</p>

"noteref" id="xd21e5226src" href="#xd21e5226" name=
"xd21e5226src">37</a> as occurring among the V&#275;dans of Travancore.
&ldquo;The wife at menstruation is secluded for five days in a hut a
quarter of a mile from her home, which is also used by her at
childbirth. The next five days are passed in a second hut, half way
between the first and her house. On the ninth day her husband holds a
feast, sprinkles his floor with wine, and invites his friends to a
spread of rice and palm wine. Until this evening, he has not dared to
eat anything but roots, for fear of being killed by the devil. On the
tenth day he must leave his house, to which he may not return until the
women, his and her sister have bathed his wife, escorted her home, and
eaten rice together. For four days after his return, however, he may
not eat rice in his own house, or have connection with his
wife.&rdquo;</p>

belong to the V&#275;gi or Vengi country, the former name of part of
the modern Kistna district. The V&#275;gina K&#333;matis are said to
have entered the fire-pits with the caste goddess Kanyakamma.</p>

Paraiyans, and an exogamous sept or sub-division of K&#257;nikars in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>Travancore. V&#275;lanmar (spearmen) occurs as a
name for the hill tribes of Travancore.</p>
<p><b>Velakkattalavan.</b>&mdash;Velakkattalavan or Vilakkattalavan is
stated in the Travancore Census Report, 1901, to indicate chieftains
among barbers, and to be the name for members of families, from which
persons are selected to shave kings or nobles. In the Madras Census
Report, 1891, Velakkattalavan is said to be &ldquo;the name in South
Malabar of the caste that shaves N&#257;yars and higher castes. The
same man is called in North Malabar Valinchiyan, N&#257;vidan, or
N&#257;siyan. In dress and habits the caste resembles N&#257;yars, and
they call themselves N&#257;yars in the south. Many returned their main
caste as N&#257;yar. The females of this caste frequently act as
midwives to N&#257;yars. In North Malabar, the Valinchiyan and
N&#257;siyan follow the N&#257;yar system of inheritance, whereas the
N&#257;vidan has inheritance in the male line; but, even amongst the
latter, t&#257;li-kettu and sambandham are performed separately by
different bridegrooms. In South Malabar the caste generally follows
descent in the male line, but in some places the other system is also
found.&rdquo; S&#363;dra K&#257;vutiyan is recorded, in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, as a synonym of Velakkatalavan.</p>
<p><b>Velama.</b>&mdash;The Velamas, or, as they are sometimes called,
Yelamas, are a caste of agriculturists, who dwell in the Telugu country
and Ganjam. Concerning them Mr. H. A. Stuart writes as
follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5259src" href="#xd21e5259" name=
"xd21e5259src">38</a> &ldquo;Who the Velamas were it seems difficult to
decide. Some say they form a sub-division of the Balijas, but this they
themselves most vehemently deny, and the Balijas derisively call them
G&#363;na S&#257;kala (or Ts&#257;kala) v&#257;ndlu (hunch-backed
washermen). The pride and jealousy of Hindu castes was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>amusingly illustrated by the Velamas of
K&#257;lahasti. The Deputy Tahsildar of that town was desired to
ascertain the origin of the name G&#363;ni S&#257;kalav&#257;ndlu, but,
as soon as he asked the question, a member of the caste lodged a
complaint of defamation against him before the District Magistrate. The
nickname appears to have been applied to them, because, in the northern
districts, some print chintzes, and, carrying their goods in a bundle
on their backs, walk stooping like a laden washerman. This derivation
is more than doubtful, for, in the God&#257;vari district, the name is
G&#363;na S&#257;kalav&#257;ndlu, g&#363;na being the big pot in which
they dye the chintzes. Some Velamas say that they belong to the Kammas,
but divided from them in consequence of a difference of opinion on the
subject of g&#333;sha, most Velama females being now kept in seclusion.
[In the Kurnool Manual it is noted that the Velama women are supposed
to be g&#333;sha, but, owing to poverty, the rule is not strictly
observed.] Both Kammas and Velamas, before they divided, are said to
have adopted g&#333;sha from the Muhammadans, but, finding that they
were thus handicapped in their competition with other cultivating
castes, it was proposed that the original custom of their ancestors
should be reverted to. Those who agreed signed a bond, which, being
upon palm leaf, was called kamma, and from it they took this name. The
dissentients retained g&#333;sha, and were therefore called outsiders
or Velamas. This does not, however, explain what the original name of
the caste was, and the truth of the story is doubtful. Since this
dispute, the Velamas have themselves had a split on the subject of
g&#333;sha, those who have thrown it off being called Adi or original
Velamas, and the others Padma Velamas. The Velamas seem to have come
south with the Vijayanagara kings, and to have been made
Menk&#257;valgars, from which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338"
href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>position some rose to be
Poligars. Now they are chiefly the hangers-on of poligars or
cultivators. To distinguish them from the Vell&#257;las in the southern
t&#257;luks, they call themselves Telugu Vell&#257;las, but it seems
very improbable that the Velamas and Vell&#257;las ever had any
connection with one another. They are styled Naidus.&rdquo; [The
Velamas style themselves Telugu Vell&#257;las, not because of any
connection between the two castes, but because they are at the top of
the Telugu castes as the Vell&#257;las are of the Tamil castes. For the
same reason, Vell&#257;las are sometimes called Arava (Tamil)
Velamalu.]</p>
<p>The most important sub-divisions returned by the Velamas at the
census, 1891, were K&#257;pu, Koppala, Padma, Ponn&#275;ti, and
Y&#257;n&#257;di. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; the Census Superintendent
writes, &ldquo;curious to find the Y&#257;n&#257;di sub-division so
strongly represented, for there is at the present day a wide gulf
between Velamas and Y&#257;n&#257;dis&rdquo; (a Telugu forest tribe).
In the Vizagapatam Manual, a class of cultivators called
Y&#257;n&#257;dulu is referred to; and, in the Madras Census Report,
1901, it is recorded that entries under the name Y&#257;n&#257;ti
&ldquo;were clubbed with Y&#257;n&#257;di; but it has since been
reported that, in Bissam-Acuttack t&#257;luk of the Vizagapatam Agency,
there is a separate caste called Y&#257;n&#257;ti or Y&#275;n&#275;ti
Dora which is distinct from Y&#257;n&#257;di.&rdquo; It would appear
that, as in the south, the Velamas call themselves Telugu
Vell&#257;las, so in the north they call themselves
Y&#257;n&#257;tis.</p>
<p>Concerning the G&#363;na Velamas, the Rev. J. Cain writes<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5270src" href="#xd21e5270" name=
"xd21e5270src">39</a> that &ldquo;in years gone by, members of this
class, who were desirous of getting married, had to arrange and pay the
expenses of two of the Palli (fisherman) caste, but now it is regarded
as sufficient to hang up a net in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339"
href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>the house during the time of
the marriage ceremony.&rdquo; The custom had its origin in a legend
that, generations ago, when all the members of the caste were in danger
of being swept off the face of the earth by some of their enemies, the
Pallis came to the rescue with their boats, and carried all the
G&#363;na Velamas to a place of safety. The G&#363;na Velamas, Mr. Cain
continues, were &ldquo;formerly regarded as quite an inferior caste,
but, as many members of it have been educated in Anglo-Vernacular
schools, they have found their way into almost every department and
risen in the social scale. Their caste occupation is that of dyeing
cloth, which they dip into large pots (g&#363;nas). The term G&#363;na
Ts&#257;kala is one of reproach, and they much prefer being called
Velamalu to the great disgust of the R&#257;ca (R&#257;ja)
Velamalu.&rdquo; To the R&#257;ca Velama section belong, among other
wealthy land-owners, the R&#257;jas of Bobbili, Venkatagiri,
Pittap&#363;r, and Nuzv&#299;d. At the annual Samasth&#257;nam meeting,
in 1906, the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja of Bobbili announced that &ldquo;none
of the Velamav&#257;ru were working in any of the offices at the time
when I first came to Bobbili. There were then a small number acting as
mere supervisors without clerical work. Only from the commencement of
my administration these people have been gradually taken into the
office, and induced to read at the High School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following note on the Velamas who have settled in the
Vizagapatam district, I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The
following sub-divisions of the caste may be noted:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Pedda or Padma found chiefly in the Bobbili t&#257;luk. Those
composing it are said to be the descendants of the military followers
and dependents of Pedda R&#257;judu, the founder of the Bobbili family,
who received a territorial grant in 1652 from Sh&#275;r Muhammad
Kh&#257;n, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>Moghul Fauzdar of Chicacole. It is to this
sub-division that Orme refers, when he says<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5281src" href="#xd21e5281" name="xd21e5281src">40</a> that they
&ldquo;esteem themselves the highest blood of Native Indians, next to
the Br&#257;hmans, equal to the Rajpoots, and support their
pre-eminence by the haughtiest observances, insomuch that the breath of
a different religion, and even of the meaner Indians, requires
ablution; their women never transfer themselves to a second, but burn
with the husband of their virginity.&rdquo; The remarriage of widows is
forbidden, and women remain g&#333;sha (in seclusion), and wear gold or
silver bangles on both wrists, unlike those of the Koppala section. The
title of members of this sub-division is Dora.</p>
<p>(2) Kamma Velama found chiefly in the Kistna district, from which
some families are said to have emigrated in company with the early
R&#257;jas of Vizian&#257;gram. They are met with almost solely in the
town of Vizian&#257;gram. The remarriage of widows is permitted, but
females are g&#333;sha. The title is N&#257;yudu.</p>
<p>(3) Koppala, or Toththala, who do not shave their heads, but tie the
hair in a knot (koppu) on the top of the head. They are divided into
sections, <i>e.g.</i>, N&#257;ga (cobra), Sankha (chank shell, <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Turbinella rapa</i>), Tulasi (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ocimum
sanctum</i>), and T&#257;b&#275;lu (tortoise). These have no
significance so far as marriage is concerned. They are further divided
into exogamous septs, or intip&#275;rulu, of which the following are
examples:&mdash;Nalla (black), Doddi (court-yard, cattle-pen or
sheep-fold), Reddi (synonym of K&#257;pu). The custom of
m&#275;narikam, by which a man marries his maternal uncle&rsquo;s
daughter, is observed. A Br&#257;hman officiates at marriages. Widows
are permitted to remarry seven times, and, by an unusual <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>custom, an elder brother is allowed to marry the
widow of his younger brother. Women wear on the right wrist a solid
silver bangle called ghatti kadiyam, and on the left wrist two bangles
called sand&#275;lu, between which are black glass bangles, which are
broken when a woman becomes a widow. The titles of members of this
sub-division are Anna, Ayya, and, when they become prosperous,
N&#257;yudu.</p>
<p>In a note on the Velamas of the God&#257;vari district, Mr. F. R.
Hemingway writes that they &ldquo;admit that they always arrange for a
M&#257;la couple to marry, before they have a marriage in their own
houses, and that they provide the necessary funds for the M&#257;la
marriage. They explain the custom by a story to the effect that a
M&#257;la once allowed a Velama to sacrifice him in order to obtain a
hidden treasure, and they say that this custom is observed out of
gratitude for the discovery of the treasure which resulted. The Rev. J.
Cain gives<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5301src" href="#xd21e5301" name=
"xd21e5301src">41</a> a similar custom among the Velamas of
Bhadr&#257;chalam in the God&#257;vari district, only in this case it
is a Palli (fisherman) who has to be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is, a correspondent informs me, a regular gradation in the
social scale among the Velamas, Kammas, and K&#257;pus, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Velama Dora = Velama Esquire.</li>
<li>Kamma V&#257;ru = Mr. Kamma.</li>
<li>K&#257;pu.</li>
</ul>
<p>A complaint was once made on the ground that, in a pattah
(title-deed), a man was called Kamma, and not Kamma V&#257;ru.</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. H. G. Prendergast<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5319src" href="#xd21e5319" name="xd21e5319src">42</a> that the
custom of sending a sword to represent an unavoidably <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>absent bridegroom at a wedding is not uncommon
among the Telugu R&#257;zus and Velamas.</p>
<p><b>V&#275;lampan</b> (rope-dancer).&mdash;Possibly a name for the
Koravas of Malabar, who perform feats on the tight-rope.</p>
<p><b>V&#275;lan.</b>&mdash;As a diminutive form of Vell&#257;la,
V&#275;lan occurs as a title assumed by some Kusavans. V&#275;lan is
also recorded as a title of Paraiyans in Travancore. (<i>See</i>
P&#257;nan.)</p>
<p>For the following note on the V&#275;lans of the Cochin State, I am
indebted to Mr. L. K. Anantha Krishna Iyer.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5337src" href="#xd21e5337" name="xd21e5337src">43</a></p>
<p>The V&#275;lans, like the P&#257;nans, are a caste of devil-dancers,
sorcerers and quack doctors, and are, in the northern parts of the
State, called Perumann&#257;ns or Mann&#257;ns (washermen). My
informant, a Perumann&#257;n at Trich&#363;r, told me that their
castemen south of the Karuvann&#363;r bridge, about ten miles south of
Trich&#363;r, are called V&#275;lans, and that they neither interdine
nor intermarry, because they give m&#257;ttu (a washed cloth) to
carpenters to free them from pollution. The Mann&#257;ns, who give the
m&#257;ttu to Izhuvans, do not give it to Kamm&#257;lans (artisan
classes), who are superior to them in social status. The V&#275;lans at
Ernakulam, Cochin, and other places, are said to belong to eight
illams. A similar division into illams exists among the
Perumann&#257;ns of the Trich&#363;r t&#257;luk. The Perumann&#257;ns
of the Chitt&#363;r <span class="corr" id="xd21e5342" title=
"Source: taluk">t&#257;luk</span> have no knowledge of this illam
division existing among them.</p>
<p>The following story was given regarding the origin of the
V&#275;lans and Mann&#257;ns. Once upon a time, when Param&#275;swara
and his wife Parvati were amusing themselves, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span>the
latter chanced to make an elephant with earth, which was accidentally
trodden on by the former, whence arose a man who stood bowing before
them. He was called the Mann&#257;n because he came out of man (earth),
and to him was assigned his present occupation. This tradition is
referred to in the songs which are sung on the fourth day of a
girl&rsquo;s first menses, when she takes a ceremonial bath to free her
from pollution.</p>
<p>The V&#275;lans are found all over the southern parts of the State,
as their brethren are in the northern parts. They live in thatched huts
in cocoanut gardens, while the Mann&#257;ns occupy similar dwellings in
small compounds either of their own, or of some landlord whose tenant
they may be.</p>
<p>When a girl attains puberty, she is at once bathed, and located in a
room in the hut. Her period of seclusion is four days. On the morning
of the fourth day, she is seated in a pandal (booth) put up in front of
the hut, and made to hold in her hand a leafy vessel filled with rice,
a few annas and a lighted wick, when a few of the castemen sing songs
connected with puberty till so late as one or two o&rsquo;clock, when
the girl is bathed. After this, the castemen and women who are invited
are feasted along with the girl, who is neatly dressed and adorned in
her best. Again the girl takes her seat in the pandal and the tunes
begin, and are continued till seven or eight o&rsquo;clock next
morning, when the ceremony comes to an end. The songsters are
remunerated with three paras of paddy (unhusked rice), twenty-eight
cocoanuts<a id="xd21e5353" name="xd21e5353"></a>, thirteen annas and
four pies, and two pieces of cloth. The songs are in some families
postponed till the sixteenth day, or to the day of the girl&rsquo;s
marriage. Very poor people dispense with them altogether. The following
is a translation of one of the songs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb344" href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day a girl and her friends were playing merrily on the banks of
a river, when one of them noticed some blood on her dress. They took
her home, and her parents believed it to have been caused by some
wound, but on enquiry knew that their daughter was in her menses. The
daughter asked her mother as to what she did with the cloth she wore
during her menses, when she was told that she bathed and came home,
leaving it on a branch of a mango tree. On further enquiry, she knew
that the goddess Ganga purified herself by a bath, leaving her cloth in
the river; that the goddess earth buried it in earth; and that Panchali
returned home after a bath, leaving her dress on a branch of a banyan
tree. Unwilling to lose her dress, the girl went to the god
Param&#275;swara, and implored his aid to get somebody to have her
cloth washed. When muttering a mantram (prayer), he sprinkled some
water, a few drops of which went up and became stars, and from a few
more, which fell on the leaves of a banyan tree, there came out a man,
to whom was assigned the task of washing the cloths of the women in
their courses, wearing which alone the women are purified by a
bath.</p>
<p>When a young man of the V&#275;lan caste has attained the
marriageable age, his father and maternal uncle select a suitable girl
as a wife, after a proper examination and agreement of their
horoscopes. The preliminaries are arranged in the hut of the girl, and
a portion of the bride&rsquo;s price, fifteen fanams, is paid. The
auspicious day for the wedding is fixed, and the number of guests that
should attend it is determined. The wedding is celebrated at the
girl&rsquo;s hut, in front of which a shed is put up. The ceremony
generally takes place at night. A few hours before it, the bridegroom
and his party arrive at the bride&rsquo;s hut, where they are welcomed,
and seated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>on mats spread on the floor in the pandal
(shed). At the auspicious hour, when the relatives on both sides and
the castemen are assembled, the bridegroom&rsquo;s enangan (relation by
marriage) hands over a metal plate containing the wedding suit, the
bride&rsquo;s price, and a few packets of betel leaves and nuts to the
bride&rsquo;s enangan, who takes everything except the cloth to be
given to the bride&rsquo;s mother, and returns the plate to the same
man. The bridegroom&rsquo;s sister dresses the bride in the new cloth,
and takes her to the pandal, to seat her along with the bridegroom, and
to serve one or two spoonfuls of milk and a few pieces of plantain
fruit, when the bride is formally declared to be the wife of the young
man and a member of his family. The guests assembled are treated to a
feast, after which they are served with betel leaves, nuts, and
tobacco. The rest of the night is spent in merry songs and dancing. The
songs refer to the marriage of S&#299;ta, the wife of R&#257;ma, of
Subhadra, wife of Arjuna, and of Panchali, wife of the P&#257;ndavas.
Next morning, the bride&rsquo;s party is treated to rice kanji (gruel)
at eight o&rsquo;clock, and to a sumptuous meal at twelve
o&rsquo;clock, after which they repair to the bridegroom&rsquo;s hut,
accompanied by the bride, her parents and relations, all of whom
receive a welcome. The formalities are gone through here also, and the
bride&rsquo;s party is feasted. On the fourth morning, the newly
married couple bathe and dress themselves neatly, to worship the deity
at the local temple. After dinner they go to the bride&rsquo;s hut,
where they spend a week or two, after which the bridegroom returns to
his hut with his wife. It is now that the bride receives a few
ornaments, a metal dish for taking meals, a lamp, and a few metal
utensils, which vary according to the circumstances of her parents.
Henceforward, the husband <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href=
"#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span>and wife live with the parents of
the former in their family.</p>
<p>Among the Mann&#257;ns of the northern parts of the State, the
following marriage customs are found to prevail. The bridegroom&rsquo;s
father, his maternal uncle, enangan, and the third or middle man,
conjointly select the girl after due examination and agreement of
horoscopes. The preliminaries are arranged as before, and the day for
the wedding is determined. At the auspicious moment on the wedding day,
when the relatives on both sides and the castemen are assembled at the
shed in front of the bride&rsquo;s hut, the bridegroom&rsquo;s father
takes up a metal plate containing the wedding dress, the bride&rsquo;s
price (twelve fanams), and a few bundles of betel leaves, nuts and
tobacco, and repeats a formula, of which the substance runs thus.
&ldquo;A lighted lamp is placed in the shed. Four mats are spread round
it in the direction of east, west, north and south. A metal plate,
containing rice, flowers and betel leaves, is placed in front of the
lamp, and the elderly members of the caste and the relatives on both
sides are assembled. According to the traditional custom of the caste,
the young man&rsquo;s father, maternal uncle, enangan, and the middle
man conjointly selected the girl after satisfying themselves with due
agreement of horoscopes, and ascertaining the illams and kriyams on
both sides. They have <span class="corr" id="xd21e5366" title=
"Source: negociated">negotiated</span> for the girl, and settled the
day on which the marriage is to take place. In token of this, they have
taken meals in the bride&rsquo;s family. The claims of the girl for two
pieces of cloth for the &#332;nam festival, two fanams or nine annas
for Thiruwatira (a festival in Dhanu, <i>i.e.</i>, December-January),
and Vishu, are satisfied, and she is by the young man taken to the
village festival. They have now come for the celebration of the
wedding. There <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347</a>]</span>have been times when he has heard of 101 fanams
as the price of the bride, and has seen 51 fanams as the price of the
same, but it is now 21 fanams. It thus varies, and may be increased or
diminished according to the will, pleasure, and means of the parties.
With four fanams as the price of the bride and eight fanams for
ornaments, and with the bundles of betel leaves, nuts, and the wedding
dress in a metal plate, may I, ye elderly members, give it to the
girl&rsquo;s parents?&rdquo; &ldquo;Shall I,&rdquo; answers the
girl&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;accept it?&rdquo; Receiving it, he gives it
to his brother-in-law, who gives it to the enangan, and he takes
everything in it except the wedding suit, which he hands over to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s enangan, who gives it to the bridegroom&rsquo;s
sister, to have the bride dressed in it. The other portions of the
ceremony are the same as those described above. In Palghat and the
Chitt&#363;r t&#257;luk, the following declaration is made.
&ldquo;According to the customary traditions of the caste, when a young
man of one locality comes to tame a girl of another locality, and takes
her as his wife, ye elderly members assembled here, may these four
bundles of betel leaves, four measures of rice, two pieces of cloth,
and ten fanams be given to the bride&rsquo;s parents?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shall these be accepted?&rdquo; says the bride&rsquo;s enangan.
When the bride accompanies the bridegroom to his hut, the following
formal statement is made. &ldquo;Thrash thou mayst, but not with a
stick. Thou mayst not accuse her of bad conduct. Thou mayst not cut off
her ears, breasts, nose and tufts of hair. Thou mayst not take her to a
tank (to bathe), or to a temple (for swearing). Thou mayst keep and
protect her as long as thou wantest. When thou dost not want her, give
her maintenance, and take back the children, for they are thine

<p>Polygamy is not prohibited, but is rarely practiced by the
V&#275;lans and Mann&#257;ns. They are very poor, and find it difficult
to support their wives and children born in a single married life. Want
of children, bodily defect or incurable disease, or want of additional
hands for work, may sometimes induce them to take more than one wife.
Polyandry does not prevail among the V&#275;lans, but is common among
the Mann&#257;ns of the northern parts of the State. A V&#275;lan woman
who loses her husband may marry another of her caste, if she likes, a
year after her husband&rsquo;s death. The formalities of the wedding
consist in the husband giving two pieces of cloth to the woman who
wishes to enter into wedlock with him. After this she forfeits all
claim on the property of her former husband. Among the Mann&#257;ns, a
widow may marry any one of her brothers-in-law. A woman committing
adultery with a member of her own caste is well thrashed. One who
disposes of herself to a member of a lower caste is sent out of caste.
She may then become a Christian or Muhammadan convert. If an unmarried
young woman becomes pregnant, and this is known to her castemen, they
convene a meeting, and find out the secret lover, whom they compel to
take her as his wife. Very often they are both fined, and the fine is
spent on toddy. Both among the V&#275;lans and Mann&#257;ns, divorce is
easy. A man who does not like his wife has only to take her to her
original home and give charge of her to her parents, informing them of
the circumstances which have induced him to adopt such a course. A
woman who does not like her husband may relinquish him, and join her
parents. In both <span class="corr" id="xd21e5378" title=
"Source: case">cases</span>, the woman is at liberty to marry
again.</p>
<p>When a woman is pregnant, the ceremony of pulikuti (drinking of
tamarind juice) is performed for her during <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>the
ninth month at the hut of her husband. The juice is extracted from
tamarind (<i lang="la-x-bio"><span class="corr" id="xd21e5386" title=
"Source: T&#257;marindus">Tamarindus</span> indica</i>), kotapuli
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Garcinia Cambogia</i>), nerinjampuli (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Hibiscus surattensis</i>) and the leaves of ambazhampuli
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Spondias mangifera</i>). A large branch of
ambazhampuli is stuck in the ground in the central courtyard, near
which the pregnant woman is seated. The husband gives her three small
spoonfuls, and then seven times with her cherut&#257;li (neck ornament)
dipped in the juice. Among the washermen, the woman&rsquo;s brother
gives it three times to her. Should her sister-in-law give it in a
small vessel, she has a claim to two pieces of cloth. After this, a
quarter measure of gingelly (<i lang="la-x-bio">Sesamum</i>) oil is
poured upon her head, to be rubbed all over her body, and she bathes,
using <i lang="la-x-bio">Acacia Intsia</i> as soap. Those of her
relatives and the castemen who are invited are sumptuously fed. Some of
them crack jokes by asking the pregnant woman to promise her baby son
or daughter to theirs when grown up. All bless her for a safe delivery
and healthy child.</p>
<p>A woman who is about to become a mother is lodged in a separate room
for her delivery, attended by her mother and one or two grown-up women,
who act as midwives. The period of pollution is fifteen days. For the
first three days the woman is given a dose of dried ginger mixed with
palmyra (<i lang="la-x-bio">Borassus flabellifer</i>) jaggery (crude
sugar), and for the next three days a mixture of garlic and jaggery.
Her diet during the first three days is rice kanji with scrapings of
cocoanut, which are believed to help the formation of the
mother&rsquo;s milk. For the next three days, the juice of kotapuli
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Garcinia Cambogia</i>), cumin seeds, and kotal
urikki (<i lang="la-x-bio">Achyranthes aspera</i>), and of the leaves
of muringa (<i lang="la-x-bio">Moringa pterygosperma</i>) is given,
after which, for a few more days, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350"
href="#pb350" name="pb350">350</a>]</span>a dose of the flesh of fowl
mixed with mustard, cumin seeds and uluva (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Trigonella f&oelig;num-gr&aelig;cum</i>) boiled in gingelly
oil is taken. She bathes in water boiled with medicinal herbs on the
fourth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, and sixteenth days. On the morning of
the sixteenth day, her enangathi (enangan&rsquo;s wife) cleans her room
with water mixed with <span class="corr" id="xd21e5426" title=
"Source: cowdung">cow-dung</span>, and sweeps the compound. Wearing a
m&#257;ttu (washed cloth) brought by a washerman, she bathes to be
freed from pollution. She may now enter the hut, and mingle with the
rest of the family.</p>
<p>Among V&#275;lans and Mann&#257;ns, the sons inherit the property of
their fathers, but they are very poor, and have little or nothing to
inherit.</p>
<p>V&#275;lans and Mann&#257;ns practice magic and sorcery. All
diseases that flesh is heir to are, in the opinion of these people,
caused by malignant demons, and they profess to cure, with the aid of
their mantrams and amulets, people suffering from maladies. The
muttering of the following mantram, and throwing of bhasmam (holy
ashes), in propitiation of the small-pox demon is believed to effect a
cure.</p>
<p>(1) &#332;m, Oh! thou, Pallyamma, mother with tusk-like teeth, that
in demoniacal form appearest on the burning ground called omkara, with
burning piles flaming around, with one breast on one of thy shoulders,
and playing with the other as with a ball, with thy tongue stretched
out and wound round thy head, with grass, beans, and pepper in thy left
hand, with gingelly seeds and chama grains in thy right hand, that
scatterest and sowest broadcast the seeds of small-pox; Oh! let the
seeds that thou hast sown, and those that thou hast not sown, dry up
inside, and get charred outside. Be thou as if intoxicated with joy!
Protect thou, protect thou!</p>
<p>(2) Malign influence of birds on children. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span></p>
<p>Oh! thou round-eyed, short Karinkali with big ears, born from the
third incessantly burning eye of Siva, come, come and be in
possession.</p>
<p>If this mantram be muttered sixteen times, and bhasmam thrown over
the body of a child, the operator breathing violently the while, a cure
will be effected. If the mantram be muttered in a vessel of water the
same number of times, and the child bathed in it, the cure will be
equally effective.</p>
<p>(3) To cure fits and fever.</p>
<p>Oh! thou swine-faced mother, thou catchest hold of my enemy, coming
charging me, by the neck with thy tusks thrust into his body; draggest
him on the ground, and standest slowly chewing and eating, thrusting
thy tusks, rubbing again, and wearing down his body, chewing once more
and again; thou, mother that controllest 41,448 demons presiding over
all kinds of maladies, seventy-two Bhiravans, eighteen kinds of
epileptic fits (korka), twelve kinds of muyalis and all other kinds of
illness, as also Kandakaranans (demons with bell-shaped ears), be under
my possession so long as I serve thee.</p>
<p>This mantram should be repeated sixteen times, with bhasmam thrown
on the body of the patient.</p>
<p>(4) Oh! Bhadrakali, thou hast drunk the full cup. Oh! thou that
holdest the sword of royalty in thy right hand, and that half sittest
on a high seat. Place under control, as I am piously uttering the
mantrams to serve thee, all demons, namely Yakshi, Gandharvan,
Poomalagandharvan, Chutali, N&#299;rali, N&#299;lankari, Chuzali, and
many others who cause all kinds of illness that flesh is heir to. Oh!
holy mother, Bhadrakali, I vow by my preceptor.</p>
<p>(5) For devil driving. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href=
"#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span></p>
<p>Oh! thou, Karinkutti (black dwarf) of Vedapuram in Vellanad, that
pluckest the fruits of the right hand branch of the strychnine tree
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Strychnos Nux-vomica</i>), and keepest toddy in its
shell, drinking the blood of the black domestic fowl, drumming and
keeping time on the rind of the fruit, filling and blowing thy pipe or
horn through the nose. Oh! thou primeval black dwarf, so long as I
utter the proper mantrams, I beg thee to cause such demons as would not
dance to dance, and others to jump and drive them out. Oh! thou,
Karinkutti, come, come, and enable me to succeed in my attempts.</p>
<p>(6) Oh! thou goddess with face. Oh! thou with face like that of a
bear, and thou, a hunter. I utter thy mantrams and meditate upon thee,
and therefore request thee to tread upon my enemies, burst open their
bodies to drink their blood, and yawn to take complete rest; drive out
such demons as cause convulsions of the body both from within and
without, and all kinds of fever. Scatter them as dust. I swear by thee
and my preceptor. Swahah.</p>
<p>(7) For the evil eye.</p>
<p>Salutations to thee, Oh! God. Even as the moon wanes in its
brightness at the sight of the sun, even as the bird chakora (Eraya)
disappears at the sight of the moon; even as the great Vasuki (king of
serpents) vanishes at the sight of chakora; even as the poison vanishes
from his head; so may the potency of his evil eye with thy aid
vanish.</p>
<p>(8) To cause delay in the occurrence of menses.</p>
<p>Salutation to thee, Oh! Mars (the son of the goddess Earth).</p>
<p>If this mantram is muttered on a thread dyed yellow with turmeric,
and if the thread be placed on both the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>palms joined
together, and if the number of days to which the occurrence of the
menses should be delayed be thought of, the postponement will be
procured by wearing it either round the neck or the loins. The thread
with a ring attached to it, and worn round the neck is equally
effective.</p>
<p>(9) To prevent cows from giving milk.</p>
<p>&#332;m, Koss, dry up the liquid, kindly present me with thy
gracious aspect. Oh! thou with the great sword in thy hands, the great
trident, dry up the cow&rsquo;s udder even as a tiger, I swear by thee
and my preceptor.</p>
<p>(10) To cause cows to give milk.</p>
<p>Even as the swelling on the holy feet of Mah&#257;d&#275;va due to
the bite of a crocodile has subsided and gone down, so go down. I swear
by my preceptor.</p>
<p>(11) To remove a thorn from the sole of the foot.</p>
<p>When Param&#275;swara and Parvathi started on their hunting
expedition, a thorn entered the foot of her lady-ship. It was doubted
whether it was the thorn of a bamboo, an ant, or a strychnine tree.
Even so may this poison cease to hurt, Oh! Lord. I swear by my
preceptor.</p>
<p>(12) To effect metamorphosis.</p>
<p>Take the head of a dog and burn it, and plant on it vellakutti
plant. Burn camphor and frankincense, and adore it. Then pluck the
root. Mix it with the milk of a dog and the bones of a cat. A mark made
with the mixture on the forehead will enable any person to assume the
figure of any animal he thinks of.</p>
<p>(13) Before a stick of the Malankara plant, worship with a lighted
wick and incense. Then chant the Sakti mantram 101 times, and mutter
the mantram to give life at the bottom. Watch carefully which way the
stick inclines. Proceed to the south of the stick, and pluck
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=
"pb354">354</a>]</span>the whiskers of a live tiger, and make with them
a ball of the veerali silk, string it with silk, and enclose it within
the ear. Stand on the palms of the hand to attain the disguise of a
tiger, and, with the stick in hand, think of a cat, white bull, or
other animal. Then you will, in the eyes of others, appear as such.</p>
<p>(14) Take the nest of a crow from a margosa tree, and bury it at the
cremation ground. Then throw it into the house of your enemy. The house
will soon take fire.</p>
<p>(15) Take the ashes of the burial-ground on which an ass has been
rolling on a Saturday or Sunday, and put it in the house of your enemy.
The members of the family will soon quit the house, or a severe illness
will attack them.</p>
<p>The V&#275;lans and Mann&#257;ns are animists, and worship
demoniacal gods, such as Chandan, Mundian, Kandakaranan, Karinkutti,
and Ch&#257;than. All of them are separately represented by stones
located underneath a tree in the corners of their compounds. Offerings
of sheep, fowls, plantain fruits, cocoanuts, parched rice and beaten
rice, are made to them on the tenth of Dhanu (last week in December),
on a Tuesday in Makaram (January-February), and on Kumbham Bharani
(second asterism in March-April). They also adore the goddess
Bhagavathi and the spirits of their departed ancestors, who are
believed to exercise their influence in their families for good or
evil. Sometimes, when they go to Cranganore to worship the goddess
there, they visit the senior male members of the local N&#257;yar,
Kamm&#257;lan and Izhuvan families to take leave of them, when they are
given a few annas with which they purchase fowls, etc., to be given as
offerings to the local goddess. Wooden or metal images, representing
the spirits of their ancestors, are located in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>a
room of their huts, and worshipped with offerings on New Moon and
Sankranti nights.</p>
<p>The V&#275;lans and Mann&#257;ns either burn or bury the dead. The
son is the chief mourner who performs the funeral rites, and the
nephews and brothers take part in them. Their priests are known as
Kurup, and they preside at the ceremonies. Death pollution lasts for
sixteen days, and on the morning of the sixteenth day the hut of the
dead person is well swept and cleansed by sprinkling water mixed with
cowdung. The members of the family, dressed in the m&#257;ttu (a washed
cloth worn before bathing) brought by the washerman, bathe to be free
from pollution. The castemen, including their friends and relations,
are invited and feasted. A similar funeral feast is also held at the
end of the year.</p>
<p>The chief occupation of the V&#275;lans and Mann&#257;ns is the
giving of m&#257;ttu to Br&#257;hmans, Kshatriyas, Anthalaraj&#257;tis,
N&#257;yars, Kamm&#257;lans and Izhuvans, for wearing before going to
bathe on the day on which they are freed from pollution. A girl or
woman in her courses on the morning of the fourth day, a woman in
confinement on the fifth, ninth, eleventh and sixteenth days, and all
the members of a family under death pollution on the sixteenth day,
have to use it. They bathe wearing the washed cloth, and return it as
soon as the bath is over. It may either belong to the washerman, or
have been previously given to him by the members of the family. He gets
an anna or a measure of paddy for his service to a woman in her menses,
and a para of paddy or six annas for birth and death pollutions. The
V&#275;lans give the m&#257;ttu to all the castes above mentioned,
while the Mann&#257;ns refuse to give it to the Kamm&#257;lans, and
thereby profess themselves to be superior in status to them. They wash
clothes to dress the idols in some of the high <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>caste temples. Their washing consists in first
plunging the dirty cloths in water mixed with cowdung, and beating them
on a stone by the side of a tank (pond), canal or river, and again
immersing them in water mixed with wood ashes or charamannu, after
which they are exposed to steam for a few hours, and again beaten on
the stone, slightly moistening in water now and then, until they are
quite clean. They are then dried in the sun, and again moistened with a
solution of starch and indigo, when they are exposed to the air to dry.
When dry, they are folded, and beaten with a heavy club, so as to be
like those ironed. The V&#275;lans of the Cranganore, Cochin, and
Kanayann&#363;r t&#257;luks, climb cocoanut trees to pluck cocoanuts,
and get about eight to ten annas for every hundred trees they go up.
They make umbrellas. Some among them practice magic and sorcery, and
some are quack doctors, who treat sickly children. Some are now engaged
in agricultural operations, while a few make beds, pillows, and coats.
There are also a few of them in every village who are songsters, and
whose services are availed of on certain ceremonial occasions, namely,
on the bathing day of a girl in her first menses, on the wedding night,
and when religious ceremonies are performed, and sacrifices offered to
their gods. Some are experts in drum-beating, and are invited by low
caste people of the rural parts. The Mann&#257;ns also follow the same
occupations.</p>
<p>The V&#275;lans and Mann&#257;ns eat at the hands of all castes
above them, namely, Br&#257;hmans, Kshatriyas, N&#257;yars, and
Izhuvans. The former take food from Kamm&#257;lans, while the latter
abstain from so doing. They do not eat the food prepared by Kaniyans,
P&#257;nans, Vilkurups, or other castes of equal or inferior status.
They have to stand at a distance of twenty-four feet from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>Br&#257;hmans. They have their own barbers, and
are their own washermen. They stand far away from the outer wall of the
temples of high castes. They are not allowed to take water from the
wells of high caste S&#363;dras, nor are they allowed to live in their
midst.</p>
<p>The following note on the V&#275;lans of Travancore has been
furnished by Mr. N. Subramani Iyer.</p>
<p>The word V&#275;lan has been derived from vel a spear, and also from
vela work. The usual title of the V&#275;lans is Panikkan. They are
believed to be divided into four classes, viz., Bharata V&#275;lan,
Vaha V&#275;lan, Pana V&#275;lan, and Manna V&#275;lan. While the last
of these sections, in addition to their traditional occupation, are
washermen and climbers of areca palm trees, the Pana V&#275;lans take
sawing as a supplementary employment. Some of the members of the first
and second classes are also physicians. This classification is
gradually going out of vogue.</p>
<p>The V&#275;lans are said traditionally to have been descended from
Siva, who, on one occasion, is believed to have removed the evil
effects of the sorcery of demons upon Vishnu by means of exorcism. As
this kind of injury began to increase among men, a man and woman were
created by this deity, to prevent its dire consequences. In the
K&#275;ralolpatti, this caste is mentioned as Velakkuruppu. But at
present the Puranadis, who are the barbers and priests of this class,
are known by this name. A Puranadi means one who stands outside, and is
not admitted as of equal rank with the V&#275;lans proper. The
Puranadis are not washermen. Commensal relations exist only between the
male members of the V&#275;lans and Puranitis (Puranadi females).</p>
<p>The V&#275;lans perform a number of useful services in the body
politic of Malabar. In the K&#275;ralolpatti their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>duty
is said to be the nursing of women in their confinement. In the
K&#275;rala-Visesha-Mahatmya, exorcism, climbing of trees, and washing
clothes, are mentioned as their occupations. There are various kinds of
exorcism, the chief being V&#275;lan Tullal and V&#275;lan Pravarti.
The former is a kind of masque performed by the V&#275;lans for warding
off the effects of the evil eye, and preventing the injurious
influences of demons and spirits. Atavi is a peculiar female divinity
worshipped by the caste, by whose help these feats are believed to be
performed in the main. She, and a host of minor gods and goddesses, are
represented by them, and a dance commences. After it is over, all the
characters receive presents. V&#275;lan Pravarti, or Otuka, may either
last for eleven days, or may be finished on a minor scale within three
days, and in emergent cases even in one day. A Puranadi acts as
buffoon, and serves the purpose of a domestic servant on the occasion.
This is called Pallipana when performed in temples, Pallipperu when in
palaces, and V&#275;lan Pravarti or Satru-eduppu in the case of
ordinary people. This is also done with a view to prevent the effect of
the evil eye. On the first day, a person representing the enchanted man
or woman is placed in a temporary shed built for the purpose, and
lights are waved before him. On the third day, a pit is dug, and a cock
sacrificed. On the fourth day, the Pattata Bali, or human sacrifice,
takes place. A person is thrown into a pit which is covered with a
plank of wood, upon which sacrifices are offered. The buried person
soon resuscitates himself, and, advancing as if possessed, explains the
cause of the disease or calamity. On the eighth day, figures of snakes,
in gold or silver, are enclosed in small copper vessels, and milk and
fruit are offered to them. On the ninth day, the V&#275;lans worship
the lords of the eight <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href=
"#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span>directions, with Brahma or the
creator in the midst of them. On the tenth day, there is much festivity
and amusement, and the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata is sung in a condensed
form. The chief of the V&#275;lans becomes possessed, and prays that,
as the P&#257;ndavas emerged safely from the sorcery of the Kauravas,
the person affected by the calamity may escape unhurt. On the last day,
animals are sacrificed at the four corners of the compound surrounding
the house. No special rite is performed on the first day, but the
Ituvanabali, Kuzhibali, Pattatabali, Kitangubali, Patalabali,
Sarakutabali, Pithabali, Azhibali, Digbali, and Kumpubali, are
respectively observed during the remaining ten days. The Pana, of which
rite the breaking of cocoanuts is the most important item, completes
this long ceremony. It was once supposed that the Bharata V&#275;lans
exorcised spirits in the homes of high caste Hindus, the same work
being done among the middle classes by the Vaha V&#275;lans, and among
the low by the Manna V&#275;lans. This rule does not hold good at the
present day. The V&#275;lans are also engaged in the event of bad
crops.</p>
<p>Besides standing thirty-two feet apart from Hindu temples, and
worshipping the divinities therein, the V&#275;lans erect small
sanctuaries for Siva within their own compounds, called Kuriyala. They
worship this deity in preference to others, and offer tender cocoanuts,
fried rice, sugar, and plantain fruits to him on the Uttradam day in
the month of August.</p>

<p><b>Velichchap&#257;d.</b>&mdash;Of the Velichchap&#257;ds, or
oracles, of Malabar, the following account is given by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name="pb360">360</a>]</span>Mr.
F. Fawcett.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5544src" href="#xd21e5544" name=
"xd21e5544src">44</a> &ldquo;Far away in rural Malabar, I witnessed the
ceremony in which the Velichchap&#257;d exhibited his quality. It was
in the neighbourhood of a N&#257;yar house, to which thronged all the
neighbours (N&#257;yars), men and women, boys and girls. The ceremony
lasts about an hour. The N&#257;yar said it was the custom in his
family to have it done once a year, but could give no account of how
the custom originated; most probably in a vow, some ancestor having
vowed that, if such or such benefit be received, he would for ever
after have an annual performance of this ceremony in his house. It
involved some expenditure, as the Velichchap&#257;d had to be paid, and
the neighbours had to be fed. Somewhere about the middle of the little
courtyard, always as clean as a dinner table, the Velichchap&#257;d
placed a lamp (of the Malabar pattern) having a lighted wick, a kalasam
(brass vessel), some flowers, camphor, saffron (turmeric) and other
paraphernalia. Bhagavati was the deity invoked, and the business
involved offering flowers, and waving a lighted wick round the kalasam.
The Velichchap&#257;d&rsquo;s movements became quicker, and, suddenly
seizing his sword (n&#257;ndakam), he ran round the courtyard (against
the sun, as sailors say) shouting wildly. He is under the influence of
the deity who has been introduced into him, and he gives oracular
utterances to the deity&rsquo;s commands. What he said I know not, and
no one else seemed to know or care in the least, much interested though
they were in the performance. As he ran, every now and then he cut his
forehead with the sword, pressing it against the skin and sawing
vertically up and down. The blood streamed all over his face. Presently
he became wilder and wilder, and whizzed round the lamp, bending
forward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361</a>]</span>towards the kalasam. Evidently some deity, some
spirit was present here, and spoke through the mouth of the
Velichchap&#257;d. This, I think, undoubtedly represents the belief of
all who were present. When he had done whizzing round the kalasam, he
soon became a normal being, and stood before my camera. The fee for the
self-inflicted laceration is one rupee, some rice, etc. I saw the
Velichchap&#257;d about three days afterwards, going to perform
elsewhere. The wound on his forehead had healed. The careful observer
can always identify a Velichchap&#257;d by the triangular patch over
the forehead, where the hair will not grow, and where the skin is
somewhat indurated.&rdquo;</p>

A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5574src" href="#xd21e5574"
name="xd21e5574src">46</a> &ldquo;are the great farmer caste of the
Tamil country, and they are strongly represented in every Tamil
district. The word Vell&#257;lan is derived from vell&#257;nmai
[vellam, water, anmai, management?] meaning cultivation, tillage. Dr.
Oppert<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5577src" href="#xd21e5577" name=
"xd21e5577src">47</a> considers Vell&#257;lan to be etymologically
connected with Pallan, Palli, etc., the word meaning the lord of the
Vallas or Pallas. The story of their origin is as follows. Many
thousands of years ago, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href=
"#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>when the inhabitants of the world
were rude and ignorant of agriculture, a severe drought fell upon the
land, and the people prayed to Bh&#363;d&#275;vi, the goddess of the
earth, for aid. She pitied them, and produced from her body a man
carrying a plough, who showed them how to till the soil and support
themselves. His offsprings are the Vell&#257;las, who aspire to belong
to the Vaisya caste, since that includes G&#333;vaisyas,
Bh&#363;vaisyas, and Dhanavaisyas (shepherds, cultivators and
merchants). A few, therefore, constantly wear the sacred thread, but
most put it on only during marriages or funerals as a mark of the
sacred nature of the ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The traditional story of the origin of the Vell&#257;las is given as
follows in the Baramahal Records.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5584src"
href="#xd21e5584" name="xd21e5584src">48</a> &ldquo;In ancient days,
when the God Param&#275;svaradu and his consort the goddess Parvati
D&#275;vi resided on the top of Kail&#257;sa Parvata or mount of
paradise, they one day retired to amuse themselves in private, and by
chance Visvakarma, the architect of the D&#275;vatas or gods, intruded
on their privacy, which enraged them, and they said to him that, since
he had the audacity to intrude on their retirement, they would cause an
enemy of his to be born in the Bh&#363;l&#333;ka or earthly world, who
should punish him for his temerity. Visvakarma requested they would
inform him in what part of the Bh&#363;l&#333;ka or earthly world he
would be born, and further added that, if he knew the birth place, he
would annihilate him with a single blow. The divine pair replied that
the person would spring up into existence from the bowels of the earth
on the banks of the Ganga river. On this, Visvakarma took his sword,
mounted his aerial car, and flew through the regions of ether to the
banks of the Ganga river, where he anxiously <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span>waited the birth of his enemy. One day
Visvakarma observed the ground to crack near him, and a kiritam or
royal diadem appeared issuing out of the bowels of the earth, which
Visvakarma mistook for the head of his adversary, and made a cut at it
with his sword, but only struck off the kiritam. In the meantime, the
person came completely out of the earth, with a bald pate, holding in
his hand a golden ploughshare, and his neck encircled with garlands of
flowers. The angry Visvakarma instantly laid hold on him, when the Gods
Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, and the supporters of the eight corners of the
universe, appeared in all their glory, and interceded for the
earth-born personage, and said to Visvakarma thou didst vow that thou
wouldst annihilate him with a single blow, which vow thou hast not
performed; therefore with what justice hast thou a second time laid
violent hands on him? Since thou didst not succeed in thy first
attempt, it is but equitable that thou shouldst now spare him. At the
intercession and remonstrance of the gods, Visvakarma quitted his hold,
and a peace was concluded between him and his enemy on the following
stipulation, viz., that the pancha j&#257;ti, or five castes of
silversmiths, carpenters, ironsmiths, stone-cutters, and braziers, who
were the sons of Visvakarma, should be subservient to the earth-born
person. The deities bestowed on the person these three names. First
Bh&#363;mi P&#257;lakudu or saviour of the earth, because he was
produced by her. Second, Ganga kulam or descendant of the river Ganga,
by reason of having been brought forth on her banks. Third, Murdaka
P&#257;lakudu or protector of the plough, alluding to his being born
with a ploughshare in his hand, and they likewise ordained that, as he
had lost his diadem, he should not be eligible to sovereignty, but that
he and his descendants should till the ground with this privilege,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>that a person of the caste should put the crown
on the king&rsquo;s head at the coronation. They next invested him with
the yegn&#333;pavitam or string, and, in order that he might propagate
his caste, they gave him in marriage the daughters of the gods Indra
and Kub&#275;ra. At this time, the god Siva was mounted on a white
bullock, and the god Dharmar&#257;ja on a white buffalo, which they
gave him to plough the ground, and from which circumstance the caste
became surnamed Vellal W&#257;rus or those who plough with white
bullocks. After the nuptials, the deities departed to their celestial
abodes. Murdaka P&#257;lakulu had fifty-four sons by the daughter of
the god Indra, and fifty-two by the daughter of the god Kub&#275;ra,
whom he married to the one hundred and six daughters of Nala Kubarudu,
the son of Kub&#275;ra, and his sons-in-law made the following
agreement with him, viz., that thirty-five of them should be called
Bh&#363;mi P&#257;lakulu, and should till the ground; thirty-five of
them named Vellal Shetti, and their occupation be traffic; and
thirty-five of them named G&#333;vu Shetlu, and their employment
breeding and feeding of cattle. They gave the remaining one the choice
of three orders, but he would not have any connexion with <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e5591" title="Source: either">any</span> of them, from
whence they surnamed him Agmurdi or the alien. The Agmurdi had born to
him two thousand five hundred children, and became a separate caste,
assuming the appellation of Agmurdi Vellal W&#257;ru. The other
brothers had twelve thousand children, who intermarried, and lived
together as one caste, though their occupations were different....
During the reign of Krishna R&#257;yalu, whose capital was the city of
Vijayanagaram or city of victory, a person of the Vellal caste, named
Umbhi or Amultan Mudaliyar, was appointed sarvadhikari or prime
minister, who had a samprati or secretary of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>caste of Gollav&#257;ru or cowherds, whose name
was Venayaterthapalli. It so happened that a set of Bh&#257;gavata
S&#275;var, or strolling players, came to the city, and one night acted
a play in the presence of Krishna R&#257;yalu and his court. In one of
the acts, a player appeared in the garb and character of a female
cowherd, and, by mimicking the actions and manners of that caste,
afforded great diversion both to the R&#257;ja and his courtiers. But
no person seemed to be so much pleased as the prime minister, which
being perceived by his secretary, he determined on making him pay dear
for his mirth by turning the Vellal caste into ridicule, and thus hurt
his pride, and take revenge for the pleasure he expressed at seeing the
follies of the cowherd caste exposed. For that purpose, he requested
the players, when they acted another play, to dress themselves up in
the habit of a female of the Vellal caste. This scheme came to the ears
of the prime minister, who, being a proud man, was sadly vexed at the
trick, and resolved on preventing its being carried into execution;
but, having none of his own caste present to assist him, and not
knowing well how to put a stop to the business, he got into his
palanquin, and went to a Canardha Shetti or headman of the right-hand
caste, informed him of the circumstance, and begged his advice and
assistance. The Shetti replied &lsquo;Formerly the left-hand caste had
influence enough with Government to get an order issued forbidding the
right-hand caste to cultivate or traffic; therefore, when we quarrel
again, do you contrive to prevent the ryots of the Vellal caste from
cultivating the ground, so that the public revenue will fall short, and
Government will be obliged to grant us our own terms; and I will save
you from the disgrace that is intended to be put on you. The prime
minister agreed to the proposal, and went <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb366" href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>home. At night, when
the players were coming to the royal presence to act, and one of them
had on the habit of a female of the Vellal caste, the Canardha Shetti
cut off his head, and saved the honour of the prime minister. The death
of the player being reported to the R&#257;ja Krishna R&#257;yalu, he
enquired into the affair, and finding how matters stood, he directed
the prime minister and his secretary to be more circumspect in their
conduct, and not to carry their enmity to such lengths.&rsquo; Since
that time, the Vellal castes have always assisted the right-hand
against the left-hand castes.&rdquo; (<i>See</i> Kamm&#257;lan.)</p>
<p>At the time of the census, 1871, some Vell&#257;las claimed that
they had been seriously injured in reputation, and handled with great
injustice, in being classed as S&#363;dras by the Municipal
Commissioners of Madras in the classification of Hindus under the four
great divisions of Br&#257;hmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and S&#363;dras.
In their petition it was stated that &ldquo;we shall first proceed to
show that the Vell&#257;las <i>do</i> come exactly within the most
authoritative definition given of Vysias, and then point out that they
do <i>not</i> come within the like definition of S&#363;dras. First
then to the definition of <span class="corr" id="xd21e5610" title=
"Source: Visya">Vysia</span>, Manu, the paramount authority upon these
matters, says in paragraph 90 of his Institutes:&mdash;&lsquo;To keep
herds of cattle, to bestow largesses, to sacrifice, to read the
scripture, to carry on trade, to lend at interest, and to cultivate
land, are prescribed or permitted to a Vysia.&rsquo;&rdquo; In the
course of the petition, the Vell&#257;las observed that &ldquo;it is
impossible to imagine that the Vell&#257;las, a race of agriculturists
and traders, should have had to render menial service to the three
higher classes; for the very idea of service is, as it needs must be,
revolting to the Vell&#257;la, whose profession teaches him perfect
independence, and dependence, if it be, upon the sovereign alone for
the protection of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href=
"#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>proper interests. Hence a
Vell&#257;la cannot be of the S&#363;dra or servile class. Besides,
that the Vell&#257;las are recognised as a respectable body of the
community will also appear from the following. There was a ceremony
called tulabh&#257;ram (weighing in scales) observed by the ancient
kings of, at some part of their lives, distributing in charity to the
most deserving gold and silver equal to the weight of their persons;
and tradition alleges that, when the kings of Tanjore performed this
ceremony, the right to weigh the king&rsquo;s person was accorded to
the Vell&#257;lan Chettis. This shows that the Vell&#257;las have been
recognised as a respectable body of mercantile men in charge of weights
and measures (Manu 30, chap. 9). So also, in the Halasya Pur&#257;nam
of Madura, it is said that, when the King Somasundara Pandien, who was
supposed to be the very incarnation of Siva, had to be crowned, there
arose a contention as to who was to put the crown on his head. After
much discussion, it was agreed that one of the Vell&#257;las, who
formed the strength of the community (note the fact that Manu says that
<span class="corr" id="xd21e5615" title="Source: Vysya">Vysia</span>
came from the thighs of the Supreme Deity, which, as an allegory, is
interpreted to mean the strength of the State) should be appointed to
perform that part of the ceremony. Also, in Kamban&rsquo;s
R&#257;mayana, written 1,000 and odd years ago, it is said that the
priest Vasista handed the crown to a Vell&#257;la, who placed it upon
great Rama&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In &lsquo;The Tamils eighteen hundred years ago,&rsquo; Mr. V.
Kanakasabhai writes that &ldquo;among the pure Tamils, the class most
honoured was the Arivar or Sages. Next in rank to the Arivar were the
Ulavar or farmers. The Arivars were ascetics, but, of the men living in
society, the farmers occupied the highest position. They formed the
nobility, or the landed aristocracy, of the country. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span>They
were also called Vell&#257;lar, &lsquo;lords of the flood,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Karalar,&rsquo; &lsquo;lords of the clouds,&rsquo; titles
expressive of their skill in controlling floods, and in storing water
for agricultural purposes. The Chera, Chola and Pandyan Kings, and most
of the petty chiefs of Tamilakam, belonged to the tribe of
Vell&#257;las. The poor families of Vell&#257;las who owned small
estates were generally spoken of as the Veelkudi-Uluvar or &lsquo;the
fallen Vell&#257;las,&rsquo; implying thereby that the rest of the
Vell&#257;las were wealthy land-holders. When Karik&#257;l the Great
defeated the Aruv&#257;lar, and annexed their territory to his kingdom,
he distributed the conquered lands among Vell&#257;la chiefs.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5622src" href="#xd21e5622" name=
"xd21e5622src">49</a> The descendants of some of these chiefs are to
this day in possession of their lands, which they hold as petty
zamindars under the British Government.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5625src" href="#xd21e5625" name="xd21e5625src">50</a> The
Vell&#257;la families who conquered Vadukam, or the modern Telugu
country, were called Velamas, and the great zamindars there still
belong to the Velama caste. In the Canarese country, the Vell&#257;las
founded the Bell&#257;l dynasty, which ruled that country for several
centuries. The Vell&#257;las were also called the Gangakula or
Gangavamsa, because they derived their descent from the great and
powerful tribe named G&#257;ngvida, which inhabited the valley of the
Ganges, as mentioned by Pliny and Ptolemy. A portion of Mysore which
was peopled mostly by Vell&#257;las was called Gangav&#257;di in the
tenth and eleventh centuries of the Christian era. Another dynasty of
kings of this tribe, who ruled Orissa in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, was known as the Gangavamsa.... In the earliest Tamil
grammar extant, which was composed by a Br&#257;hman named
Tholk&#257;ppiyan, in the first or second century B.C., <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>frequent allusions are made to the Arivar or
Sages. But, in the chapter in which he describes the classes of
society, the author omits all mention of the Arivar, and places the
Brahmins who wear the sacred thread as the first caste. The kings, he
says, very guardedly, and not warriors, form the second caste, as if
the three kings Chera, Chola and P&#257;ndy could form a caste; all who
live by trade belong to the third caste. He does not say that either
the kings or the merchants wear the sacred thread. Then he singles out
the Vell&#257;las, and states that they have no other calling than the
cultivation of the soil. Here he does not say that the Vell&#257;las
are Sudras, but indirectly implies that the ordinary Vell&#257;las
should be reckoned as Sudras, and that those Vell&#257;las who were
kings should be honoured as Kshatriyas. This is the first attempt made
by the Brahmins to bring the Tamils under their caste system. But, in
the absence of the Kshatriya, Vaisya, and Sudra castes in Tamilakam,
they could not possibly succeed; and to this day the Vell&#257;la does
not take meals at the hands of a Padaiyadchi, who calls himself a
Kshatriya, or a merchant who passes for a Vaisya.&rdquo; In speculating
on the origin of the Vell&#257;las, Mr. J. H. Nelson<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5630src" href="#xd21e5630" name="xd21e5630src">51</a> states
that &ldquo;tradition uniformly declares them to be the descendants of
foreign immigrants, who were introduced by the P&#257;ndyas: and it
appears to be extremely probable that they are, and that an extensive
Vell&#257;la immigration took place at a rather remote period, perhaps
a little before or after the colonization of the Tonda-mandala by
Adondai Chakravarti. The Vell&#257;las speak a pure dialect of Tamil,
and no other language. I have not heard of anything extraordinary in
the customs prevailing among them, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb370" href="#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span>of any peculiarities
pointing to a non-Tamil origin.... With regard to the assertion so
commonly made that the P&#257;ndyas belonged to the Vell&#257;la caste,
it is observable that tradition is at issue with it, and declares that
the P&#257;ndyas proper were Kshatriyas: but they were accustomed to
marry wives of inferior castes as well as and in addition to wives of
their own caste; and some of their descendants born of the inferior and
irregularly married wives were Vell&#257;lans, and, after the death of
K&#363;n or Sundara P&#257;ndya, formed a new dynasty, known as that of
the pseudo-P&#257;ndyas. Tradition also says that Arya N&#257;yaga
Muthali, the great general of the sixteenth century, was dissuaded by
his family priest from making himself a king on the ground that he was
a Vell&#257;lan, and no Vell&#257;lan ought to be a king. And, looking
at all the facts of the case, it is somewhat difficult to avoid coming
to the conclusion that the reason assigned for his not assuming the
crown was the true one. This, however, is a question, the settlement of
which requires great antiquarian learning: and it must be settled
hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1871, the Vell&#257;las are described
as &ldquo;a peace-loving, frugal, and industrious people, and, in the
cultivation of rice, betel, tobacco, etc., have perhaps no equals in
the world. They will not condescend to work of a degrading nature. Some
are well educated, and employed in Government service, and as clerks,
merchants, shop-keepers, etc., but the greater part of them are the
peasant proprietors of the soil, and confine their attention to
cultivation.&rdquo; In the Madura Manual, it is recorded that
&ldquo;most Vell&#257;lans support themselves by husbandry, which,
according to native ideas, is their only proper means of livelihood.
But they will not touch the plough, if they can help it, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>ordinarily they do everything by means of hired
servants and predial slaves. In the Sathaga of N&#257;r&#257;yanan may
be found a description of their duties and position in society, of
which the following translation appears in Taylor&rsquo;s work, the
Oriental MSS. The Vell&#257;lans, by the effect of their ploughing (or
cultivation), maintain the prayers of the Br&#257;hmans, the strength
of kings, the profits of merchants, the welfare of all. Charity,
donations, the enjoyments of domestic life, and connubial happiness,
homage to the gods, the S&#257;stras, the V&#275;das, the Pur&#257;nas,
and all other books, truth, reputation, renown, the very being of the
gods, things of good report or integrity, the good order of castes, and
(manual) skill, all these things come to pass by the merit (or
efficacy) of the Vell&#257;lan&rsquo;s plough. Those Vell&#257;lans who
are not farmers, husbandmen, or gardeners, are employed in various ways
more or less respectable; but none of them will condescend to do work
of a degrading nature. Some of them are merchants, some shop-keepers,
some Government servants, some sepoys, some domestic servants, some
clerks, and so forth.&rdquo; In the Tanjore Manual, it is stated that
&ldquo;many Vell&#257;lars are found in the Government service, more
especially as karnams or village accountants. As accountants they are
unsurpassed, and the facility with which, in by-gone days, they used to
write on cadjan or palmyra leaves with iron styles, and pick up any
information on any given points from a mass of these leaves, by
lamp-light no less than by daylight, was most remarkable. Running by
the side of the Tahsildar&rsquo;s (native revenue officer) palanquin,
they could write to dictation, and even make arithmetical calculations
with strictest accuracy. In religious observances, they are more strict
than the generality of Br&#257;hmans; they abstain from both
intoxicating liquors <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372"
name="pb372">372</a>]</span>and flesh meat.&rdquo; In the Coimbatore
Manual, the Vell&#257;las are summed up as &ldquo;truly the backbone of
the district. It is they who, by their industry and frugality, create
and develop wealth, support the administration, and find the money for
imperial and district demands. As their own proverb says:&mdash;The
Vell&#257;lar&rsquo;s goad is the ruler&rsquo;s sceptre. The bulk of
them call themselves Goundans.&rdquo; In the Salem Manual, the
Vell&#257;la is described as &ldquo;frugal and saving to the extreme;
his hard-working wife knows no finery, and the Vell&#257;lichi,
(Vell&#257;la woman) willingly wears for the whole year the one blue
cloth, which is all that the domestic economy of the house allows her.
If she gets wet, it must dry on her; and, if she would wash her sole
garment, half is unwrapped to be operated upon, which in its turn
relieves the other half, that is then and there similarly hammered
against some stone by the side of the village tank (pond), or on the
bank of the neighbouring stream. Their food is the cheapest of the
&lsquo;dry&rsquo; grains which they happen to cultivate that year, and
not even the village feasts can draw the money out of a
Vell&#257;lar&rsquo;s clutches. It is all expended on his land, if the
policy of the revenue administration of the country be liberal, and the
acts of Government such as to give confidence to the ryots or
husbandmen; otherwise their hoarded gains are buried. The new moon, or
some high holiday, may perhaps see the head of the house enjoy a
platter of rice and a little meat, but such extravagance is
rare.&rdquo; The Vell&#257;las are summed up by &lsquo;A
Native,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5642src" href="#xd21e5642"
name="xd21e5642src">52</a> as being &ldquo;found in almost every
station of life, from the labourer in the fields to the petty zamindar
(landholder); from the owner of plantations to the cooly who works at
coffee-picking; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373"
name="pb373">373</a>]</span>from the Deputy Collector to the peon in
his office.&rdquo; It is recorded, in the Census Report, 1871, that a
Vell&#257;la had passed the M.A. degree examination of the Madras
University. The occupations of the Vell&#257;las whom I examined in
Madras were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In an excellent summary of the Vell&#257;las<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5676src" href="#xd21e5676" name="xd21e5676src">53</a> Mr. W.
Francis writes as follows. &ldquo;By general consent, the first place
in social esteem among the Tamil S&#363;dra castes is awarded to them.
To give detailed descriptions of the varying customs of a caste which
numbers, as this does, over two and a quarter millions, and is found
all over the Presidency, is unnecessary, but the internal construction
of the caste, its self-contained and distinct sub-divisions, and the
methods by which its numbers are enhanced by accretions from other
castes, are so typical of the corresponding characteristics of the
Madras castes, that it seems to be worth while to set them out
shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The caste is first of all split up into four main divisions,
named after the tract of country in which the ancestors of each
originally resided. These are (1) Tondamandalam, or the dwellers in the
Pallava country, the present Chingleput and North Arcot districts, the
titles of which division are Mudali, Reddi and Nainar; (2) S&#333;liya
(or S&#333;zhia), or men of the Ch&#333;la country, the Tanjore and
Trichinopoly districts of the present day, the members of which are
called Pillai; (3) P&#257;ndya, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb374" href="#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>inhabitants of the
P&#257;ndyan Kingdom of Madura and Tinnevelly, which division also uses
the title of Pillai; and (4) Konga, or those who resided in the Konga
country, which corresponded to Coimbatore and Salem, the men of which
are called Kavandans. The members of all these four main territorial
divisions resemble one another in their essential customs. Marriage is
either infant or adult, the Pur&#257;nic wedding ceremonies are
followed, and (except among the Konga Vell&#257;las) Br&#257;hmans
officiate. They all burn their dead, observe fifteen days&rsquo;
pollution, and perform the karum&#257;ntaram ceremony to remove the
pollution on the sixteenth day. There are no marked occupational
differences amongst them, most of them being cultivators or traders.
Each division contains both Vaishnavites and Saivites, and (contrary to
the rule among the Br&#257;hmans) differences of sect are not of
themselves any bar to intermarriage. Each division has Pand&#257;rams,
or priests, recruited from among its members, who officiate at funerals
and minor ceremonies, and some of these wear the sacred thread, while
other Vell&#257;las only wear it at funerals. All Vell&#257;las perform
sr&#257;ddhas (memorial services), and observe the ceremony of invoking
their ancestors on the Mah&#257;laya days (a piece of ritual which is
confined to the twice-born and the higher classes of S&#363;dras); all
of them decline to drink alcohol or to eat in the houses of any but
Br&#257;hmans; and all of them may dine together. Yet no member of any
of these four main divisions may marry into another, and, moreover,
each of them is split into sub-divisions (having generally a
territorial origin), the members of which again may not intermarry.
Thus Tondamandalam are sub-divided into the Tuluvas, who are supposed
to have come from the Tulu country; the Poonamallee (or Pundamalli)
Vell&#257;las, so called from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375"
href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>town of that name near
Madras; and the Kondaikattis (those who tie their hair in a knot
without shaving it). None of these three will intermarry. The
S&#333;liya Vell&#257;las are sub-divided into the Vell&#257;n Chettis,
meaning the Vell&#257;la merchants (who are again further split up into
three or four other territorial divisions); the Kodikk&#257;ls
(betel-garden), who grow the betel-vine; and the
K&#257;nakkilin&#257;tt&#257;r, or inhabitants of
K&#257;nakkilin&#257;du. These three similarly may not intermarry, but
the last is such a small unit, and girls in it are getting so scarce,
that its members are now going to other sub-divisions for their brides.
The P&#257;ndya Vell&#257;las are sub-divided into the
K&#257;rkatt&#257;s or K&#257;raik&#257;tus, who, notwithstanding the
legends about their origin, are probably a territorial sub-division
named from a place called K&#257;raik&#257;du; the Nangudis and
Panjais, the origin of whom is not clear; the Arumb&#363;rs and
Sirukudis, so called from villages of those names in the P&#257;ndya
country; the Agamudaiyans, who are probably recruits from the caste of
that name; the N&#299;rpusis, meaning the wearers of the sacred ashes;
and the K&#333;ttai Vell&#257;las or fort Vell&#257;las. These last are
a small sub-division, the members of which live in Sr&#299;vaikuntam
fort (in Tinnevelly), and observe the strictest g&#333;sha (seclusion
of females). Though they are, as has been seen, a sub-division of a
caste, yet their objection to marry outside their own circle is so
strong that, though they are fast dying out because there are so few
girls among them, they decline to go to the other sub-divisions for
brides. [<i>See</i> K&#333;ttai Vell&#257;la.] The Kongas are
sub-divided into the Sendalais (red-headed men), Paditalais (leaders of
armies), Vellikkai (the silver hands), Pavalamkatti (wearers of coral),
Malaiyadi (foot of the hills), Tollak&#257;du (ears with big holes),
Attangarais (river bank), and others, the origin of none of which is
clearly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span>known, but the members of which never
intermarry. In addition to all these divisions and sub-divisions of the
Vell&#257;la caste proper, there are nowadays many groups which really
belong to quite distinct castes, but which call themselves
Vell&#257;las, and pretend that they belong to that caste, although in
origin they had no connection with it. These nominally cannot
intermarry with any of the genuine Vell&#257;las, but the caste is so
widely diffused that it cannot protect itself against these invasions,
and, after a few generations, the origin of the new recruits is
forgotten, and they have no difficulty in passing themselves off as
real members of the community. The same thing occurs among the
N&#257;yars in Malabar. It may be imagined what a mixture of blood
arises from this practice, and how puzzling the variations in the
cranial measurements of Vell&#257;las taken at random are likely to
become. Instances of members of other castes who have assumed the name
and position of the Vell&#257;las are the V&#275;ttuva Vell&#257;las,
who are really V&#275;ttuvans; the P&#363;luva Vell&#257;las, who are
only P&#363;luvans; the Illam Vell&#257;las, who are Panikkans; the
Karaiturai (lord of the shore) Vell&#257;las, who are Karaiy&#257;ns;
the Karukamattai (palmyra leaf-stem) Vell&#257;las, who are
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns; the G&#257;zulu (bangle) Vell&#257;las, who are
Balijas; the Guha (R&#257;ma&rsquo;s boat-man) Vell&#257;las, who are
Sembadavans; and the Irkuli Vell&#257;las, who are Vann&#257;ns. The
children of dancing-girls also often call themselves Mudali, and claim
in time to be Vell&#257;las; and even Paraiyans assume the title
Pillai, and trust to its eventually enabling them to pass themselves
off as members of the caste.&rdquo; The name Acchu Vell&#257;la has
been assumed by some Karaiyans, and Pattanavans call themselves
Varunakula Vell&#257;la or Varunakula Mudali, after Varuna, the god of
the waters. At times of census, many hill Malay&#257;lis return
themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>as Vell&#257;las, in accordance with their
tradition that they are Vell&#257;las who migrated to the hills. Some
thieving Koravas style themselves Aghambadiar Vell&#257;la or Pillai,
and have to some extent adopted the dress and manners of the
Vell&#257;las.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5693src" href="#xd21e5693"
name="xd21e5693src">54</a> In Travancore, to which State some
Vell&#257;las have migrated, males of the D&#275;va-d&#257;si
(dancing-girl) caste sometimes call themselves Nanchin&#257;d
Vell&#257;las. There is a Tamil proverb to the effect that a Kallan may
come to be a Maravan. By respectability he may develop into an
Agamudaiyan, and, by slow degrees, become a Vell&#257;la. According to
another proverb, the Vell&#257;las are compared to the brinjal
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Solanum Melongena</i>) fruit, which will mix
palatably with anything.</p>
<p>The account of the divisions and sub-divisions of the Vell&#257;las
recorded above may be supplemented from various sources:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Arampukutti, or Arambukatti (those who tie flower-buds).
According to Mr. J. A. Boyle,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5704src" href=
"#xd21e5704" name="xd21e5704src">55</a> the name indicates
Vell&#257;las with wreaths of the aram flower, which is one of the
decorations of Siva. They are, he writes, &ldquo;a tribal group
established in a series of villages in the Ramnad territory. The family
tradition runs that they emigrated five centuries ago from the
Tondamandalam, and that the migration was made in d&#275;vendra
vim&#257;nam or covered cars; and this form of vehicle is invariably
used in marriage ceremonies for the conveyance of the bride and
bridegroom round the village. The women never wear a cloth above the
waist, but go absolutely bare on breast and shoulders. The two rivers
which bound this district on the north and south are rigid limits to
the travels of the women, who are on no pretext allowed to cross them.
It is said that, if they make <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378"
href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>vows to the deity of a
celebrated temple in Tanjore, they have to perform their pilgrimage to
the temple in the most perfect secrecy, and that, if detected, they are
fined. Intermarriage is prohibited &lsquo;beyond the rivers.&rsquo; It
is, with the men, a tradition never to eat the salt of the Sirkar
(Government), or take any service under Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. Chetti. The members of the Vell&#257;lan subdivision of Chetti
are &ldquo;said to be pure Vell&#257;las, who have taken the title of
Chetti. In ancient times, they had the prerogative of weighing the
person of kings on occasion of the Tulabh&#257;ram ceremony.
(<i>See</i> Tulabh&#257;ram.) They were, in fact, the trading class of
the Tamil nation in the south. But, after the immigration of the more
skilful Telugu K&#333;matis and other mercantile classes, the
hereditary occupation of the Vell&#257;n Chettis gradually declined,
and consequently they were obliged to follow different professions. The
renowned poet Pattanatt&#257;r is said to have belonged to this
caste.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5714src" href="#xd21e5714"
name="xd21e5714src">56</a></p>
<p>3. K&#257;raikk&#257;t or K&#257;rk&#257;tta. The name is said to
mean Vell&#257;las who saved or protected the clouds, or waiters for
rain. Their original profession is said to have been rain-making. Their
mythological origin is as follows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In old times, a quarrel happened between the R&#257;ja of
P&#257;ndya d&#275;sa and the god D&#275;vendra, and things went to
such lengths that the angry god commanded the clouds not to send down
any rain on P&#257;ndya d&#275;sa, so that the inhabitants were sorely
distressed by the severe drought, and laid their complaints before the
R&#257;ja, who flew into a rage, marched his army against
D&#275;vendra, defeated him in battle, seized on the clouds and put
them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>in prison, in consequence of which not a drop of
rain fell on any part of the Bh&#363;loka or earthly world, which threw
the people into a great consternation, and the whole with one accord
addressed their prayers to D&#275;vendra, the god of the firmament, and
beseeched him to relieve them from their present distress.
D&#275;vendra sent an ambassador to the R&#257;ja of P&#257;ndya
d&#275;sa, and requested that he would release the clouds, but he
refused to do it unless they gave security for their future good
behaviour, and likewise promise that they would never again withhold
the rain from falling in due season on his kingdom. At this juncture,
the Vellal caste of P&#257;ndya d&#275;sa became security for the
clouds, and, from that circumstance, were surnamed K&#257;rak&#257;va
Vellal W&#257;ru, or redeemers of the clouds.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5723src" href="#xd21e5723" name="xd21e5723src">57</a> In an
interesting account of the K&#257;raikat Vell&#257;las of the Palni
hills by Lieutenant Ward in 1824,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5726src"
href="#xd21e5726" name="xd21e5726src">58</a> it is recorded that
&ldquo;their ceremonies, it is said, are performed by Pand&#257;rams,
although Br&#257;hmans usually officiate as priests in their temples.
They associate freely with the Kunnavans, and can eat food dressed by
them, as also the latter can eat food dressed by a K&#257;rakat
Vell&#257;lan. But, if a Kunnavan is invited to the house of a
K&#257;rakat Vell&#257;lan, he must not touch the cooking utensils, or
enter the cooking-room. Wives are accustomed, it is supposed, to grant
the last favor to their husband&rsquo;s relations. Adultery outside the
husband&rsquo;s family entails expulsion from caste, but the punishment
is practically not very severe, inasmuch as a Kunnavan can always be
found ready to afford protection and a home to the divorc&eacute;e. A
man who disgraces himself by an illicit connection with a woman of a
lower caste than his own is punished in a similar manner. Formerly the
punishment was in either <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href=
"#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>case death.&rdquo; It is
recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5731src" href="#xd21e5731" name=
"xd21e5731src">59</a> that &ldquo;in 1824 the K&#257;rak&#257;t
Vell&#257;las were accustomed to purchase and keep predial slaves of
the Poleiya caste, giving thirty fanams for a male, and fifty for a
female. The latter was held to be the more valuable, as being likely to
produce children for the benefit of her owner.&rdquo; It is said that,
among the K&#257;raikk&#257;t Vell&#257;las, a peculiar ceremony,
called vilakkidu kaly&#257;nam, or the auspicious ceremony of lighting
the light, is performed for girls in the seventh or ninth year or
later, but before marriage. The ceremony consists in worshipping
Gan&#275;sa and the Sun at the house of the girls&rsquo; parents. Her
maternal uncle gives her a necklace of gold beads and coral, and a new
cloth. All the relations, who are invited to be present, make gifts to
the girl. The women of this section wear this ornament, which is called
kodachimani (hooked jewel), even after marriage.</p>
<p>4. Kondaikatti. Said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5736src" href=
"#xd21e5736" name="xd21e5736src">60</a> to consider themselves as the
highest and proudest of the Vell&#257;las, because, during the
Nabob&rsquo;s Government, they were employed in the public service.
They are extremely strict in their customs, not allowing their women to
travel by any public conveyance, and punishing adultery with the utmost
severity.</p>
<p>Kondaikatti literally means one who ties his hair in a knob on the
top of his head, but the name is sometimes derived from kondai, a
crown, in connection with the following legend. A quarrel arose between
the K&#333;matis and Vell&#257;las, as to which of them should be
considered Vaisyas. They appeared before the king, who, being unable to
decide the point at issue, gave each party five thousand rupees, and
told them to return after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href=
"#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>trading for five years. The
Vell&#257;las spent one-fifth of the sum which they received in
cultivating land, while the K&#333;matis spent the whole sum in
trading. At the end of the allotted time, the Vell&#257;las had a
bumper crop of sugar-cane, and all the canes contained pearls. The
K&#333;matis showed only a small profit. The king was so pleased with
the Vell&#257;las, that he bestowed on them the right to crown
kings.</p>
<p>5. Kumbak&#333;nam. Vell&#257;las, who migrated from Kumbak&#333;nam
in the Tanjore district to Travancore.</p>
<p>6. Kummidichatti. Recorded, in the Manual of the North Arcot
district, as a sub-division, regarded as low in position, which carried
the pot (chatti) of fire at Vell&#257;la funerals. It is said that, in
default of Kummidichattis, ordinary Vell&#257;las now have to carry
their own fire at funerals.</p>
<p>7. Nangudi or Savalai Pillaimar. (<i>See</i> Nangudi.)</p>
<p>8. Tendisai (southern country). They are found in the Coimbatore
district, and it has been suggested that they are only a branch of the
Konga Vell&#257;las.</p>
<p>9. Tenk&#257;nchi. Vell&#257;las, who migrated from Tenk&#257;si in
the Tinnevelly district to Travancore. (<i>See</i> Todupuzha
Vell&#257;la.)</p>
<p>10. Tuluva. Immigrants from the Tulu country, a part of the modern
district of South Canara. Mr. Nelson<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5762src" href="#xd21e5762" name="xd21e5762src">61</a> is of
opinion that these are the original Vell&#257;las, who were invited to
Tondamandalam after its conquest by the Ch&#333;la King Adondai
Chakravarti. They are now found in all the Tamil districts, but are
most numerous in North and South Arcot and Chingleput. It is noted, in
Carr&rsquo;s &ldquo;Descriptive and historical papers relating to the
Seven Pagodas,&rdquo; that &ldquo;Adondai <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb382" href="#pb382" name="pb382">382</a>]</span>chiefly distinguished
K&#257;nch&#299;puram (Conjeeveram) and Tripati as his place of
residence or capital. The era of Adondai is not higher up than the
seventh century of our reckoning. He is said to have brought the
Br&#257;hmans from Sr&#299; Sailam in Teling&#257;na, and certainly
attracted a large colony of <span class="corr" id="xd21e5767" title=
"Source: Sudra">S&#363;dra</span> Vell&#257;las, or agriculturists,
from Tuluva or northern Canara.&rdquo; At Conjeeveram, there are a
N&#257;ttar and a D&#275;sayi, whose authority, in olden times,
extended over the whole Presidency. The N&#257;ttar must be a Tuluva
Vell&#257;la, and the D&#275;sai a Ralla Balija. The two offices
conjointly are known as the N&#257;du D&#275;sam. The authority of
these officers has in great measure ceased, but some still go to the
N&#257;du D&#275;sam for appeal. For purposes of caste organisation,
Conjeeveram is regarded as the head-quarters. All sections of the
Tondamandalam Vell&#257;las are divided into twenty-four k&#333;ttams
and seventy-nine n&#257;dus. The latter are subject to the former.</p>
<p>The following legendary account of the Tondamandalam Vell&#257;las
is given in the Baramahal Records. &ldquo;During the reign of a certain
R&#257;ja of Ch&#333;lad&#275;sa, a kingdom supposed to have comprised
the present provinces south of the river K&#257;v&#275;ri, the
countries between the Kistna and K&#257;v&#275;ri were quite a
wilderness, in which many families of the Kurbavar caste or shepherds
resided here and there in villages surrounded by mud walls. On a time,
the R&#257;ja came forth into the wilds to take the diversion of
hunting, and, in traversing the woods, he came to a place in the
vicinity of the present town of Conjeeveram in the Kingdom of Arcot,
where he met with a Naga Kanya or celestial nymph, fell in love with
her, and asked her to yield to his embraces. She replied, &lsquo;If I
consent to your proposal, and bear you a son, will you make him your
successor in the kingdom?&rsquo; He <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb383" href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>rejoined &lsquo;I
will,&rsquo; and she asked him who should witness his promise. He
answered &lsquo;the earth and sky,&rsquo; but she said that two
witnesses were not sufficient, and that there must be a third. There
happened to be a tree called <span class="corr" id="xd21e5774" title=
"Source: adhondha">adhonda</span> near them, and the R&#257;ja replied
&lsquo;Let the fruit of this adhonda tree be the third witness.&rsquo;
When she was satisfied respecting the witnesses, she granted the
R&#257;ja his desires, and, after he had remained with her a short
time, he took his leave, and returned to his metropolis, and, in a
little while, abdicated his throne in favour of his eldest son, who
managed the affairs of the kingdom. To return to the Naga Kanya, she
conceived and brought forth a son, who remained with her three or four
years, and then visited the different Rishis or hermits who resided in
the forest, and learnt from them to use the sword, the bow and arrow,
and the art of war, and obtained from them a knowledge of the whole
circle of sciences. By this time he had attained the age of sixteen
years, and, coming to his mother, he requested her to tell him who was
his father. She answered &lsquo;Thy father is the Ch&#333;la
R&#257;ja.<span class="corr" id="xd21e5777" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> He replied &lsquo;I will go to him, but
who is to bear witness to the truth of your assertion?&rsquo; She
rejoined &lsquo;The earth, sky, and the fruit of the adhonda tree are
witness to what I have told you.&rsquo; The son plucked one of the
berries of the adhonda tree, hung it by a string to his neck, took his
sword and other weapons, and set out for his father&rsquo;s capital. He
one day took an opportunity of accompanying some of the nobles to the
darbar, and called out to the old R&#257;ja &lsquo;Behold your
son.&rsquo; The R&#257;ja replied &lsquo;I know nothing of thee;&rsquo;
upon which the young man repeated everything which his mother had told
him, but it had no effect on the R&#257;ja. When the son found that his
father was determined not to acknowledge him he challenged <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span>him
to single combat, but the R&#257;ja, not thinking it proper to accept a
challenge from a rash youth, demanded if he had any witnesses to prove
his claim. He answered &lsquo;The earth and sky, and the fruit of the
adhonda tree, which I wear suspended from my neck, are witnesses to the
truth of my assertion.&rsquo; This circumstance brought the old
occurrence to the R&#257;ja&rsquo;s recollection, and he owned his son,
and told him that, as he had already abdicated the throne, he trusted
he would not insist upon the fulfilling of the promise which had been
made to his mother, but consent to live in a private station under the
dominion of his elder half-brother. The young man nobly replied
&lsquo;I with pleasure waive the performance of your promise, but point
out to me your enemy, and assist me with some troops, and I will
conquer a kingdom for myself.&rsquo; The R&#257;ja gave him an army,
and directed him to subdue the Kurubav&#257;ru or shepherds, to clear
the woods, and to form himself a kingdom between the rivers Kistna and
K&#257;v&#275;ri. He accordingly advanced into the wilderness, and,
without meeting much opposition, soon subjected the Kurubav&#257;ru,
who, knowing nothing of cultivation or sinking of tanks or watering the
country from the rivers, and the conqueror wishing to introduce
agriculture among them, he was obliged to repair to his father, and
make known his difficulties. The R&#257;ja was much pleased with the
enterprising spirit of his son, conferred on him the title of Adhonda
Chakra, wrote and permitted him to take with him such of the
Vell&#257;la caste as chose to emigrate. The young R&#257;ja held out
great encouragement, and got a number of adventurers of that caste to
accompany him back, to whom he gave large grants of waste land, and
told them to pitch upon such spots of ground as met with their
approbation, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385"
name="pb385">385</a>]</span>they fixed upon the forts, districts, and
villages belonging to the Kurubav&#257;ru caste, which consisted of
twenty-four forts, eighty-one districts, and one thousand and nine
hundred villages. This country was formerly named Dandaka Aranya.
Dandaka is the name of a famous Rakshasa or Giant, who is mentioned in
the R&#257;m&#257;yana<span class="corr" id="xd21e5785" title=
"Not in source">,</span> and Aranya signifies a wilderness. It was also
called Dhuntra N&#257;du, or the middle country, and the new R&#257;ja
named it Dhanda Mandalam, or country of the tree dhonda, alluding to
the fruit of the adhonda or dhonda tree, which bore testimony to his
descent. The emigrants of the Vell&#257;la caste surnamed themselves
Dhonda Mandala Vell&#257;la v&#257;ru, and are now corruptly called
Tondamandala Vell&#257;la v&#257;ru.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In connection with the sub-divisions of the Vell&#257;las, Mr.
Hemingway, in a note on the Vell&#257;las of the Trichinopoly district,
gives some still further information. &ldquo;The Kondaikattis are
so-called from the peculiar way in which they used to wear their
hair&mdash;a custom no longer observed. They are split into two
sections, called M&#275;ln&#257;du and K&#299;ln&#257;du (westerns and
easterns). The Dakshin&#257;tt&#257;ns (south country men) are
immigrants from Tinnevelly. The members of the K&#257;raikk&#257;ttar
sub-division in the Udaiyarp&#257;laiyam t&#257;luk are rather looked
down on by other Vell&#257;lans as being a mixed race, and are also
somewhat contemptuously called Yeruttu-m&#257;ttu (pack-bullocks),
because, in their professional calling, they formerly used
pack-bullocks. They have a curious custom by which a girl&rsquo;s
maternal uncle ties a t&#257;li (marriage badge) round her neck when
she is seven or eight years old. The Panjukk&#257;ra Chettis live in
the Udaiyarp&#257;laiyam t&#257;luk. The name is an occupational one,
and denotes cotton-men, but they are not at the present day connected
with the cotton trade. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href=
"#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span>S&#333;lap&#363;ram (or
Ch&#333;lap&#363;ram) Chettis are apparently called after the village
of that name in the Kumbakonam t&#257;luk of Tanjore. The S&#333;lias
(or Ch&#333;lias) are numerous and ubiquitous. They are generally
regarded as of doubtful descent, since <i>parvenus</i>, who wish to be
considered Vell&#257;lans, usually claim to belong to this
sub-division. The more respectable Pand&#257;rams, the Thambirans who
own temples and matams, and the Oduvar or &#256;di Saiv&#257;l, belong
to the S&#333;zhia section. The Uttun&#257;ttu sub-division is local in
origin. Its head-quarters is the country round Uttat&#363;r. The
members thereof are the special devotees of the Siva of that place. The
Arun&#257;ttus (six n&#257;dus) are also called Mottai (shaved)
Vell&#257;lans, apparently because they always shave their moustache,
and wear only a very small kudumi (hair-knot). Some of their customs
are unlike those of the rest of the caste. They have exogamous septs,
their widows always dress in white and wear no ornaments (a rule not
universally observed in any other sub-division), they never marry their
sister&rsquo;s daughter, and their wives wear the t&#257;li (marriage
badge), like the Panta Reddis, on a golden thread. Of their six
n&#257;dus, three of which are supposed to have been located on each
side of the Aiy&#257;r river, only two are now recognised. These are
the S&#275;rkudi n&#257;du in N&#257;makkal t&#257;luk and the
Omand&#363;r n&#257;du of Musiri. The Y&#275;l&#363;r (seven villages)
Vell&#257;las are very few and far between. There is a small colony of
Tuluvas, engaged in dyeing, at Illupp&#363;r. The Malaikandas are only
found near the Ratnagiri hill in the Kulittalai t&#257;luk. They take
their name from the fact that they are required to look at the
Ratnagiri hill when they get up in the morning. They are devotees of
the god there. The K&#257;niy&#257;lans (landowners) are scarce, but
widely distributed, since the man who carries <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>the
pot of blood, when animals are sacrificed at festivals to the village
goddesses, must belong to this sub-division. The Kodikkal
Vell&#257;lans are so-called from their occupation of betel
cultivation, which they still pursue largely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Konga Vell&#257;las differ so strikingly from the rest in many
of their customs that a separate account of them is given. (<i>See</i>
Konga Vell&#257;la.)</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. Hemingway that some Vell&#257;las &ldquo;observe
a curious custom (derived from Br&#257;hmans) with regard to marriage,
which is not unknown among other communities. A man marrying a second
wife after the death of his first has to marry a plantain tree, and cut
it down before tying the t&#257;li, and, in the case of a third
marriage, a man has to tie a t&#257;li first to the erukkan (arka:
<i lang="la-x-bio">Calotropis gigantea</i>) plant. The idea is that
second and fourth wives do not prosper, and the tree and the plant are
accordingly made to take their places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A peculiar ceremony, called Sevvai (Tuesday) Pillayar, is performed
by some Vell&#257;la women. It is also called Avvai Nonbu, because the
Tamil poetess observed it. The ceremony takes place twice in the year,
on a Tuesday in the months of Thai (February-March) and Audi
(August-September). It is held at midnight, and no males, even babies
in arms, may be present at it, or eat the cakes which are offered. A
certain number of women club together, and provide the necessary rice,
which is measured on the back of the hand, or in a measure similar to
those used by Madras milk-sellers, in which the bottom is fixed high up
in the cylinder. At the house where the ceremony is to be performed the
rice is pounded into flour, and mixed with leaves of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Pongamia glabra</i> and margosa (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia
Azadirachta</i>). The mixture is then made into <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>cakes, some flat, and some conical, to represent
Pillayar (Gan&#275;sa). Flowers, fruits, betel, turmeric, combs,
kunkumam (red powder), and other articles required in connection with
the Pillayar worship, are also taken to the room in which the rites are
performed. Of these it has been impossible to gather an account, as the
women refused to describe them, lest ruin should fall on their
families. Some say that, during the ceremony, the women are
stark-naked.</p>
<p>In an account of an annual ceremony at Trichinopoly in connection
with the festival of Kulumai Amman, who is the guardian deity against
epidemics, Bishop Whitehead records<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5824src"
href="#xd21e5824" name="xd21e5824src">62</a> that &ldquo;a very fat
puj&#257;ri (priest) of the Vell&#257;la caste is lifted up above the
vast crowd on the arms of two men. Some two thousand kids are then
sacrificed, one after the other. The blood of the first eight or nine
is collected in a large silver vessel holding about a quart, and handed
up to the puj&#257;ri, who drinks it. Then, as the throat of each kid
is cut, the animal is handed up to him, and he sucks, or pretends to
suck the blood out of the carcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of proverbs relating to the Vell&#257;las, the following may be
cited:&mdash;</p>
<p>Agriculture is no agriculture, unless it is performed by the
Vell&#257;las.</p>
<p>The Vell&#257;la ruined himself by gaudy dress; the courtesan ruined
herself by coquetry and affectation.</p>
<p>Of all the sections of the S&#363;dras, the Vell&#257;la is
foremost; and, of all the thefts committed in the world, those of the
Kallans are most notorious.</p>
<p>Though you may face an evil star, never oppose a Vell&#257;la.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span></p>
<p>Though apparently the Vell&#257;la will not ruin you, the palm leaf,
on which he writes about you, will certainly ruin you for ever.</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1891, Vell&#257;la is recorded as a
caste of Jains. In this connection, it is noted by Mr. Hemingway that
the Nain&#257;ns or N&#257;yin&#257;rs (<i>q.v.</i>) and the
K&#257;raikk&#257;ttans of the Udaiyarp&#257;laiyam t&#257;luk are
thought to be descended from Jains who were converted to the Hindu
faith.</p>

<p><b>Velutt&#275;dan.</b>&mdash;The Velutt&#275;dan is defined in the
Madras Census Report, 1891, as &ldquo;the washerman of the N&#257;yars
and higher castes in Malabar. He calls himself a N&#257;yar, and, in
many cases, was returned as of that main caste, but these have been
separated in abstraction. The caste is called Vannatt&#257;n in North
Malabar. The Velutt&#275;dans follow the marumakkat&#257;yam law of
inheritance in the north, and makkat&#257;yam in the south. They have
t&#257;li-kettu and sambandham separately. Their dress and habits are
the same as those of N&#257;yars.&rdquo; In the Madras Census Report,
1901, Bannata is given as a Canarese synonym for the caste name. In the
Travancore and Cochin Census Reports, 1901, Velutt&#275;tan and
Veluth&#275;dan are given respectively as an occupational title and
sub-division of N&#257;yars. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href=
"#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span></p>
<p>For the following note on the Velutt&#275;dans of Travancore, I am
indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. The name is believed to signify a
place where clothes are bleached. In the early Settlement Records the
designation recorded is Ayavu, in all probability an old synonym for
washing. The South Travancore Velutt&#275;dans are said to be divided
into two endogamous septs, Parav&#363;r and Attingal, with four
exogamous septs in each; but these distinctions may be said to have now
lost their vigour and force. There is a current tradition that once
upon a time a Br&#257;hman was washing cloths for a friend, and was on
that account thrown out of caste by Parasur&#257;ma. The occupation of
the Velutt&#275;dans is washing cloths for all high-caste Hindus down
to the S&#363;dras, in which profession, for neatness and purity at any
rate, if not for promptitude, they stand above the Vann&#257;ns and
Chayakk&#257;rans of the east coast, both of whom have now entered the
field in competition with them, and, at least in the most civilised
parts of the State, not entirely without success. In no case do the
castemen receive cloths from classes lower in social rank than the
S&#363;dras, and this is pointed to with pride as one of the causes
which keep them in their present elevated scale. It need hardly be said
that, in their traditional occupation, the Velutt&#275;dans are largely
and materially assisted by their females, the Velutt&#275;dathis. They
do not live in a group together, but are conveniently scattered about,
so as to avoid competition one with another. Their main profession is,
in many cases, supplemented by agriculture. There are absolutely no
educated men among them, and, as long as machine-laundries are not
introduced into the country, they have no reason to abandon the
profession of their forefathers in pursuit of alien ones. In the matter
of food and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>drink, as also in their dress and ornaments,
they resemble the N&#257;yars. Clothes, it may be mentioned, are never
bought by Velutt&#275;dans, as they are always in possession, though
temporarily, of other peoples&rsquo; apparel. Tattooing prevails only
in South Travancore. They cannot enter Br&#257;hmanical shrines, but
are permitted to stand outside the talakkal or stone-paved walk round
the inner sanctuary, by which the image is taken in daily procession.
Besides standing here and worshipping the higher Hindu deities, they
also engage in the propitiation of the minor village deities. There are
two headmen in each village, who punish social delinquents, and preside
over caste ceremonials. On the twenty-eighth day after the birth of a
child, the name-giving ceremony is performed, and a thread is tied
round the infant&rsquo;s neck. Those who can afford it celebrate the
first food-giving. The t&#257;li-tying and sambandham ceremonies are
performed separately, just like N&#257;yars. The former is known as
muhurtham or auspicious occasion. The marriage badge is called unta
minnu or puliyilla minnu. The details of the marriage ceremony do not
differ from those of the N&#257;yars. The ayani unu, bh&#363;takkalam,
appam poli, and avaltitti are all important items, and, at least in
South Travancore, seldom failed to be gone through. In poor families
the mother, without any formal ceremonial, ties the t&#257;li of the
girl before she is twelve years old, after an oblation of cooked food
to the rising sun. This is called Bhagavan t&#257;li, or god&rsquo;s
marriage ornament. Freedom of divorce and remarriage exist. The
pulikuti (tamarind) is an indispensable ceremonial, to be gone through
by a pregnant woman. Inheritance devolves in the female line
(marumakkatt&#257;yam). The clothes washed by Velutt&#275;dans are used
by Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hmans, without previous washing as on the
east coast, for all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392"
name="pb392">392</a>]</span>religious purposes; and clothes polluted by
a member of a low caste are purified by the Velutt&#275;dan sprinkling
ashes and water over them.</p>

<p><b>Vettiy&#257;n.</b>&mdash;Vettiy&#257;n is the name applied to one
of the officials of a Tamil Paraiyan settlement, who is also called
T&#333;ti or Th&#333;tti. The former title is said to be more
respectful as an appellation than the latter, but this is a distinction
without a difference.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5918src" href=
"#xd21e5918" name="xd21e5918src">63</a> The name Vettiy&#257;n is said
to be equivalent to Bittiy&#257;n (bitti, for nothing), or one who does
service, <i>e.g.</i>, collecting grass, firewood, etc., without
remuneration. T&#333;ti is derived from thott, to go round, as he is
the purveyor of news, and has to summon people to appear before the
village tribunal, or from tondu, to dig.</p>
<p>The duties of the Vettiy&#257;n are multifarious. He it is who goes
round the rice fields, and diverts the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb393" href="#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>water-courses to the
various fields, according to the rights of the ryots (agriculturists).
The Vettiy&#257;n beats the drum for public notices and ceremonies. As
a servant of Government, he has to carry the revenue which has been
collected to the treasury. He is sometimes entrusted with large sums of
money, and has never been known to abscond with it. It is said that the
Village Munsiff will trust the Vettiy&#257;n, but not the Tali&#257;ri,
who is never sent alone with money. The Vettiy&#257;n is in charge of
the burial ground, and those who repair thither have to pay him for his
services. He is also the grave-digger, and officiates when a Paraiyan
corpse is burnt or buried. Hence the Tamil proverb against meddling in
what ought to be left to some one else:&mdash;&ldquo;Let the
Vettiy&#257;n and corpse struggle together.&rdquo; At a Paraiyan
funeral, the Vettiy&#257;n, in some places, carries the pot of fire to
the grave. To bring down rain, some of the lower classes, instead of
addressing their prayers to the rain-god Varuna, try to induce a spirit
or d&#275;vata named Kodump&#257;vi (wicked one) to send her paramour
Sukra to the affected area. The belief seems to be that Sukra goes away
to his concubine for about six months, and, if he does not return,
drought ensues. The ceremony consists in making a huge figure of
Kodump&#257;vi in clay, which is placed on a cart, and dragged through
the streets for seven to ten days. On the last day, the final death
ceremonies of the figure are celebrated. It is disfigured, especially
in those parts which are usually concealed. Vettiy&#257;ns, who have
been shaved, accompany the figure, and perform the funeral ceremonies.
This procedure is believed to put Kodump&#257;vi to shame, and to get
her to induce Sukra to return and stay the drought.</p>
<p>At Paraiyan marriages certain pots are worshipped, and it is, in
some places, the Vettiy&#257;n who says &ldquo;The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span>sun,
the moon, the pots, and the owner of the girl have come to the marriage
booth. So make haste, and fill the pots with water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The office of the Vettiy&#257;n village official is hereditary, and
the holder of it is entitled to some respect among his brethren, and to
certain emoluments in kind, <i>e.g.</i>, grain at the harvest season.
There is a proverb that &ldquo;whatever may be the wealth of the lord
who comes to rule over him, his duty of supplying him with a bundle of
grass is not to cease.&rdquo; This relates to the demands which were,
and perhaps are still, made on him in rural parts of the country. In
some places, lands, called Vettiy&#257;n M&#257;niyam, are given
rent-free to Vettiy&#257;ns.</p>
<p>The Vettiy&#257;n is said to possess the right of removing dead
cattle from villages, and in return to supply leather for agricultural
purposes. He is further said to make drum heads and tom-toms from raw
hides.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5940src" href="#xd21e5940" name=
"xd21e5940src">64</a></p>
<p>The Vettiy&#257;ns belong to the right-hand section during disputes
between the right and left hand factions.</p>
<p><b>V&#275;ttuvan.</b>&mdash;The Tamil V&#275;ttuvans are described,
in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;an agricultural and
hunting caste, found mainly in Salem, Coimbatore, and Madura. The name
means &lsquo;a hunter.&rsquo; They are probably of the same stock as
the V&#275;dans, though the exact connection is not clear, but they now
consider themselves superior to that caste, and are even taking to
calling themselves V&#275;ttuva Vell&#257;las. Tradition says that the
Konga kings invited V&#275;ttuvans from the Ch&#333;la and P&#257;ndya
countries to assist them against the K&#275;ralas. Another story says
that the caste helped the Ch&#333;la king Aditya Varma to conquer the
Kongu country during the latter part of the ninth century. In paragraph
538 of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>the Census Report, 1891, reference is made to
the belief that the V&#275;dans are identical with the Veddahs of
Ceylon. In connection with this supposition, it is reported that the
V&#275;ttuvans worship a goddess called Kandi-Amman, which may possibly
mean &lsquo;the goddess of Kandy&rsquo; (in Ceylon). Of the endogamous
sections into which the caste is divided, the most numerically
important are Venganchi, Kilangu (root), Pasari, Viragu (firewood),
Pann&#257;dai (sheath of the cocoanut leaf), and Villi (bow). They have
their own barbers, who seem also to form a separate sub-division, and
are called V&#275;ttuva Ambattans or N&#257;vidans, both of which words
mean barber. They are said to refuse to serve any one lower than a
Konga Vell&#257;la. Nominally they are Hindus, but they are said to
worship the seven Kannimars, or aboriginal goddesses, to whom the
Irulas also pay homage. They eat meat and drink alcohol, though some of
those who are endeavouring to increase their social repute are taking
to vegetarianism. Widow marriage is forbidden. They either burn or bury
the dead, but no ceremonies are performed for deceased ancestors. Their
customs are thus a curious mixture of those followed by high castes and
low ones. Their ordinary title is Kavandan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the Malay&#257;lam V&#275;ttuvans, who live in Malabar and the
southern portion of the South Canara district, it is recorded, in the
Madras Census Report, 1901, that they are &ldquo;agricultural serfs,
shik&#257;ris (hunters), and collectors of forest produce, who live in
the Malabar jungles. They have two endogamous sub-divisions, called
Kodi and Peringala. The former keep their hair long, and their women
wear a cloth. The latter have top-knots, and their women dress in
leaves, which they wear only round their waists, and renew daily. The
latter are an unclean set of people, who live in rude <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=
"pb396">396</a>]</span>bamboo and reed huts, and will eat anything down
to carrion. Yet they consider themselves superior to Cherumans and
Pulaiyans, and are careful not to be polluted by them. This same name
is also borne by a class of masons and salt-workers in the low country
in Malabar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Malabar V&#275;ttuvans are said to have a fantastic legend,
showing that they were not originally as low as they are at the present
day in the social scale. &ldquo;It is related that one of their tribe
went and asked a high-caste N&#257;yar to give him a daughter in
marriage. The N&#257;yar offered to do so on condition that the whole
tribe would come to his place and dance on berries, each one who fell
to be shot with arrows. The tribe foolishly agreed to the condition,
and went and danced, with the result that, as each one tripped and
fell, he or she was mercilessly shot dead with arrows. A little girl
who survived this treatment was secretly rescued, and taken away by a
compassionate N&#257;yar, who married her into his family. From this
union, the present day V&#275;ttuvans affirm their origin is to be
traced. Up to this day they hold the caste of that particular
N&#257;yar in very great veneration.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5957src" href="#xd21e5957" name="xd21e5957src">65</a> The costume
of these V&#275;ttuvans has been described as follows.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5960src" href="#xd21e5960" name=
"xd21e5960src">66</a> &ldquo;The men wear a short loin-cloth, secured
round the waist by a belt which is also used as a sling during hunting
expeditions. They also wear brass ear-rings, and grow a bit of
moustache, and a little stumpy beard. The dress of the women consists
of three clusters of long leaves, suspended from the waist and tied on
by a cheap girdle. According to a tribal legend, when, in the morning
of time, costumes were being distributed by the deity to the various
races of the earth, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397"
name="pb397">397</a>]</span>the Vettuva women, being asked to choose
between a costume which needed to be changed daily, and one which
needed to be changed only yearly, readily expressed a preference for
the former, and the deity, considering this an unpardonable piece of
vanity, decreed that thenceforth the women should dress in leaves
gathered fresh every morning. Whenever it is suggested to them that
they should adopt some more lasting apparel, the Vettuva women answer
that they are carrying out the mandate of the deity, and can abandon
their present dress only if the deity appears in person, and sanctions
a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the occasion of a recent visit of the Governor of Madras to South
Canara, a party of V&#275;ttuvans was paraded before him. One of the
men was wearing an aluminium coronation medal, and, on being asked by
the Collector who had given it to him, he folded his arms obsequiously,
and replied &lsquo;My Tamburan&rsquo; (landlord).</p>
<p>In a recent note on the leaf-wearing V&#275;ttuvans, it is stated
that &ldquo;they believe that the sun travels, after it has set,
through a hole in the bowels of the earth, and emerges at morning in
the east. The way they calculate time is interesting. A V&#275;ttuvan
says that his children were born when his master sowed paddy (rice) on
such and such hills. They are a very truthful lot, of good moral
character, the chastity of their womankind being held very
sacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Malabar V&#275;ttuvans are summed up by Mr. T. K. Gopal
Panikkar<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5972src" href="#xd21e5972" name=
"xd21e5972src">67</a> as being &ldquo;not exactly slaves, but their
social position justifies their classification amongst the slave races.
They live on the cocoanut plantations of the Nairs, and other
well-to-do classes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398"
name="pb398">398</a>]</span>They lead a hand-to-hand existence on the
wages which they obtain for hedging and fencing cocoanut plantations,
plucking cocoanuts, tilling, and other allied work. They live, with
their wives and children, and sometimes other relations as well, in
houses small but more decent-looking than the mere huts of the other
lower classes. In point of caste restrictions they are certainly better
circumstanced; and their daily contact with the higher classes in the
ordinary concerns of life affords them greater facilities for increased
knowledge and civilisation than their brother citizens of the slave
races enjoy. They are much addicted to toddy-drinking, but their
principal food is rice. Their condition is never so intolerably
wretched as that of the other classes. They are sometimes employed by
cultivators for agricultural purposes. Their females occupy themselves
in the fields during the harvest season, but they also make thatch for
houses of cocoanut leaves woven after a set model during the thatching
season about December or January. Their males wear ear-rings of brass,
and their females adorn themselves with nose, finger, and neck
ornaments of brass or beads. The one piece of cloth supplied annually
by the masters, to whose plantations they are attached, forms the dress
both for males and females, which they tie round their waists. They do
not eat carrion, but are exceedingly fond of fish, the flesh of the
civet, and the rat, and of some other animals not generally eaten by
other classes. They observe death pollution like the higher classes of
Malabar, and the period of observance varies according to the
particular class or caste, to which their masters belong. For instance,
if they belong to a Nair&rsquo;s plantation, such period is fifteen
days, and, if to a Brahmin&rsquo;s, it is ten days; Nairs and Brahmins
observing pollution for these periods <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb399" href="#pb399" name="pb399">399</a>]</span>respectively. The
priests who officiate at their ceremonials are selected from among
their own tribesmen or Enangers, whose express recognition is necessary
to give validity to the performance of the ceremony. Their marriage
customs are very like those of the Tiyyars, excepting that the feasting
and revelry are not so pompous in their case. Like the Nairs, they
retain the front knot. The only offences of general occurrence among
them are petty cases of theft of cocoanuts, plantains, areca nuts, and
roots of common occurrence. The Vettuvans believe in a Supreme Creator,
whom they name and invoke as Paduchathampuram, <i>i.e.</i>, the king
who created us. Likewise, they believe in certain evil deities, to whom
they make offerings at particular times of the year. They are not, like
the other classes, distinguished by loyalty to their masters, but are a
very ungrateful sect, and their very name, viz., Nambu Vettuvan, has
passed into a bye-word for ingratitude of all kinds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of Malabar, that &ldquo;the
V&#275;ttuvans of Chirakkal taluk are a low caste of jungle cultivators
and basket makers, distinguished by the survival amongst their women of
the custom of dressing in leaves, their only clothing being a kind of
double fan-shaped apron of leaves tied round the waist with a rolled
cloth. They live in huts made of split bamboo and thatched with
elephant grass, called kudumbus. The V&#275;ttuvans are divided into
fourteen illams, which seem to be named after the house names of the
janmis (landlords) whom they serve. Their headmen, who are appointed by
their janmis, are called Kir&#257;n, or sometimes Parakutti (drummer).
Amongst the V&#275;ttuvans, when labour begins, the woman is put in a
hole dug in a corner of the hut, and left there alone with some water
till the cry of the child is heard.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>For
the following note on the V&#275;ttuvans of the Cochin State, I am
indebted to Mr. L. K. Anantha Krishna Aiyar.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5986src" href="#xd21e5986" name="xd21e5986src">68</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Vettuvans are also called Vettuva Pulayas. They are pure
agricultural labourers, taking part in every kind of work connected
with agriculture, such as ploughing, sowing, weeding, transplanting,
pumping water, and reaping. They are more day labourers. The males get
two edangazhis of paddy (hardly worth 2 annas), and the females an
edangazhi and a half. In times of scarcity, they find it difficult to
support themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When an unmarried woman becomes pregnant, her parents, as
soon as they become aware of the fact, inform their local headman
(Kanakkan or Kuruppan), who convenes a meeting of the elderly members
of the community for the purpose of summoning the secret lover, and
prosecuting the necessary enquiries. In the event of the confession of
the charge, he is asked to marry her. The matter does not end there.
They go to the local Thandan, and relate to him the incident, who
thereupon gives him water in a vessel (kindi vellam). The woman is
asked to drink this as well as some cow-dunged water, and is then made
to let flow a few drops of blood from the body. After this he says
&lsquo;dhosham thirnu&rsquo; (free from guilt). Should, however, the
lover be unwilling to marry her, he is thrashed and placed under a ban.
If they are related to each other, they are both turned out of caste.
The woman who is freed from guilt can marry again. The Thandan gets as
his perquisite four annas out of the fine imposed, four packets of
betel leaf, eight areca nuts, and three tobacco leaves. Their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=

balance which then remains is spent on toddy, and beaten rice for those
assembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Vettuvans profess the lower forms of Hinduism. Their
chief gods are Chevva, Chathan, Karinkutti, Parakutti, Kappiri and
Kandakaranan, and also Namburi Thamburan. They give regular offerings
to them, lest the gods should become angry, and cause serious
calamities to the members of their families. Images of gods are made of
bell-metal, and worshipped in their huts. The deceased ancestors are
also worshipped as gods, to whom are given a different kind of
offerings. Toddy is an indispensable item in their offerings to them.
In Ooragam and its neighbourhood, when I took my notes on the
Vettuvans, I was told that there was no tree-tapping, and that toddy
brought to them for sale was largely adulterated with water, and very
costly. Their gods were very angry, for they were not satisfied with
it. They caused fever, deafness, blindness, and other disorders. They
worship K&#257;li also. Kumbhom Bharani is an important festival to
them. On the morning of this day, tunes are played in honour of the
goddess. There are special songs called Thottampattu. Sacrifices are
offered to the deity very early. A p&#363;ja (worship) is also
performed for the sword, anklets, and bells worn round the loins, all
placed in front of the deity, and songs are again sung. One of them
turns a Velichchap&#257;d (oracle), who speaks as if by inspiration.
Wearing the above ornaments, they go to a temple, in front of which
they empty out on a mat a few paras of paddy, and again play and
sing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The funeral ceremonies of the Vettuvans are somewhat
elaborate. When a member of the caste breathes his last, his relations,
friends, and other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402"
name="pb402">402</a>]</span>castemen of the kara (settlement) are all
informed of the event. They attend, and take part in the obsequies. The
dead body is bathed, and dressed in a piece of new cloth. Some gold,
rubbed on a stone in water, is poured into his mouth by his sons and
daughters. Karuvanguka, or Gurutvam Vanguka, is an important ceremony
performed by his sons and daughters. It consists in taking sixteen
small bits of plantain leaves, with some rice on each, and placing them
on the forehead, neck, chest, loins, thighs, hands, legs, feet, etc.,
washing the last two, and collecting the water, which is taken in by
the members junior to him in the family. After this, the dead body is
placed on the bier, which is carried by four persons to the grave. The
nearest relatives of the family, four in number, called Bhedakars, with
a mundu (cloth) tied round their heads, walk in front of the
procession. The grave is dug, and a new cloth is spread, and the corpse
laid on it. It is filled in with layers of earth and stones, to prevent
dogs and jackals from disturbing the dead body. All those who have
accompanied the chief mourner bathe, and return home. The members of
the family fast for the night. The eldest son, who is the chief
mourner, bathes in the early morning, and offers the pinda bali
(offering of rice) to the spirit of the departed for fifteen days. On
the seventh day, the chief mourner, and the Enangan, go to the
graveyard, and level the slightly raised part of the grave. A piece of
stone, kept near the foot, is taken, and placed on a leaf. Some toddy,
arrack (alcoholic liquor) and water of the tender cocoanut, are poured
over it as offerings. By some magic, the spirit is supposed to be
living in it. It is brought home, and placed in a cocoanut shell
containing oil mixed with turmeric, and kept outside the hut until the
pollution is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>over. The pollution lasts for fifteen days, and
on the night of the fifteenth day they fast. On the morning of the
sixteenth day, all the castemen of the kara who are invited bring with
them rice, curry-stuffs, and toddy. Rubbing themselves with oil, they
all go to bathe, after which the Enangan sprinkles cowdunged water, to
show that they are freed from pollution. The stone is also purified by
a dip in water, and then brought home. Those who have assembled are
fed, and then depart. The chief mourner, who has to perform the diksha,
does not shave for a year, bathes in the early morning, and offers the
bali before going to work. This he continues for a year, at the end of
which he gets himself shaved, and celebrates a feast called masam in
honour of the departed. The stone, representing the deceased, is placed
on a seat in a conspicuous part of the hut. An image of wood or copper
sometimes takes its place. It is thenceforward worshipped, and believed
to watch over the welfare of the family. Regular offerings are given to
it on Karkadagom and Thulam Sankranthi, &#332;nam, Vishu, and the
festival day of the local temple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The castes below the Vettuvans are Pulayan, Nay&#257;di, and
Ullatan. They consider themselves superior to Pulayas, and are careful
not to be polluted by them. A Vettuvan who is polluted by a Nay&#257;di
or Ulladan fasts for seven days, subsisting on water, tender cocoanuts,
and toddy. On the eighth day he bathes, and takes his regular meals. As
the Vettuvans are Chandalars, any distance less than sixty-four feet
will pollute the higher castes. They stand at a distance of twenty-four
feet from Kamm&#257;lar. Nay&#257;dis and Ullatans stand far from them.
Owing to their disabilities and low wages, many turn either Christians
or Muhammadans, and work for wages of two and a half to three annas a
day.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=

<p>There is a class of people in Malabar called Vettan or Vettuvan,
which must not be confused with the jungle V&#275;ttuvan. These people
were, it is said,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6014src" href="#xd21e6014"
name="xd21e6014src">69</a> &ldquo;once salt-makers, and are now masons,
earth-workers, and quarrymen. They are said to be divided into two
classes, the marumakkatt&#257;yam (with inheritance in the female line)

inheritance from father to son), said to be immigrants from the
south.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Vilkurup.</b>&mdash;The Vilkuruppu or Vilkollakuruppu are the
priests and barbers of the Malay&#257;lam Kamm&#257;lans, and also
makers of umbrellas and bows (vil) and arrows. In former times they
supplied the latter articles for the Malabar Infantry. Malabar and
Travancore are, par excellence, the home of the palm-leaf umbrella,
which still holds its own against umbrellas of European manufacture,
which were, in 1904&ndash;1905, imported into India to the value of Rs.
18,95,064. A native policeman, protecting himself from the sun with a
long-handled palm umbrella, is a common object in towns and villages on
the west coast.</p>

href="#xd21e6031" name="xd21e6031src">70</a> &ldquo;In former times,
their occupations were training low caste men to arms and athletic

and arrows, and pial school teaching. In these days of civilisation,
their services are no longer required for these purposes, and they are
employed in shampooing, umbrella making, and quarrying laterite stones
for building purposes. In N&#257;yar families, during t&#257;li-tying
ceremonies, they have to give a bow and a few arrows. During the
&#332;nam festival also, they have to give a bow and arrows to every
N&#257;yar house, for which they get some paddy (rice), curry stuffs, a
cocoanut, and some oil. When they are called in for shampooing, three
oils are well boiled, and cooled. The patient lies on a plank, oil is
poured over him, and every part of his body is well shampooed, and
afterwards he is bathed in water boiled with medicinal herbs. The
Vilkurups eat at the hands of Br&#257;hmans, N&#257;yars, Izhuvans, and
Kamm&#257;lans, but abstain from taking the food of barbers, washermen,
P&#257;n&#257;ns, Kaniyans, and other low castes. They have to stand at
a distance of thirty-two feet from Br&#257;hmans and N&#257;yars.

<p>They are Ling&#257;yats, but do not, as a rule, wear the lingam, as
it is the custom to postpone initiation until death, when the linga is
tied on the corpse by a Jangam before it is buried. Those who are
initiated during life wear the linga suspended from the neck. The
V&#299;ramushtis seem to have several sub-divisions, <i>e.g.</i>,
N&#257;ga Mallika (<i lang="la-x-bio">Rhinacanthus communis</i>), the
roots of which are believed to cure snake-bite, Puccha Kaya (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Citrullus Colocynthis</i>), Triputa (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Ipom&oelig;a Turpethum</i>), and Ramadosa (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Cucumis Melo</i>).</p>
<p>Girls are married before or after puberty. The m&#275;narikam
custom, according to which a man should marry his maternal
uncle&rsquo;s daughter, is observed. A v&#333;li (bride-price) of
sixteen rupees, or half a tola of gold, in the form of jewelry, is
given to the bride.</p>
<p>The V&#299;ramushtis are professional acrobats and mendicants, and
are attached to the D&#275;v&#257;ngas and K&#333;matis. The following
legends are current to account for their connection with these castes.
In days gone by, there was, in a big town, a great Ling&#257;yat mutt
(monastery) named Basavanna Mandiram, presided over by a Jangam priest
named Basavanna. The mutt contained three hundred crores of
Ling&#257;yat priests, and great wealth was stored in it. This the
V&#299;r&#257;mushtis guarded against thieves. A Telaga, Chikayya by
name, who was a professional thief, determined to plunder the mutt, in
order to satisfy his mistress. One night, when the V&#299;ramushtis
were fast asleep, he entered the mutt, but, when he saw a number of
Jangams engaged in devout worship, he abandoned his project, and
determined to turn Ling&#257;yat. Accordingly, at day-break, he
advanced to the place where the head of the mutt was seated, made known
to him who he was, and informed him of his resolution. Opinions were
divided as to the fitness of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href=
"#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span>receiving such an applicant, but
it was finally decided that, if a man repented, he was a fit person to
be received into the Ling&#257;yat fold, as the linga recognises no
caste. The linga was accordingly tied on his neck. From that time
Chikayya became a new man and a true Jangam, and went from place to
place visiting sacred shrines. One day he happened to be at a place
where lived a merchant prince, who never dined except in the company of
a Jangam. On the suggestion of his wife N&#299;lakuntalad&#275;vi, an
invitation to dine was sent to Chikayya, who accepted it. After dinner,
the merchant went out on business, and N&#299;lakuntalad&#275;vi,
noticing what a beautiful man Chikayya was, fell in love with him. He,
however, rejected her advances, and ran away, leaving his knapsack
behind him. N&#299;lakuntalad&#275;vi cut off her golden necklace, and,
having placed it in the knapsack, ran after Chikayya, and threw it at
him, asking him to accept it. She then inflicted several cuts on
herself, and, as soon as her husband returned home, complained that the
Jangam had stolen her necklace, and attempted to ravish her.
Information was sent to Basayya, the head of the mutt, and a council
meeting summoned, at which it was decided that Chikayya should have his
head cut off. The order to carry out this act was given to the
V&#299;ramushtis, who went in search of him, and at last found him
beneath the shade of a tree overhanging the bank of a river, engaged in
worshipping his linga, which was in his hand. On searching the
knapsack, they found the necklace, and proceeded to cut off
Chikayya&rsquo;s head, which went several hundred feet up into the air,
and travelled towards the mutt, whither the headless trunk followed on
foot. On their return to the mutt, the V&#299;ramushtis found that the
three hundred crores of priests had been miraculously beheaded, and the
place <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=
"pb409">409</a>]</span>was a vast pool of blood. As soon, however, as
the head and body of Chikayya approached, they became re-united, and
Siva, appearing on the scene, translated him to kyl&#257;s (heaven). At
the same time, he restored the priests to life, and inflicted the
following four curses on the V&#299;ramushtis:&mdash;(1) they were not
to build or use houses, and are consequently found living under trees
outside villages; (2) they were not to sleep on a cot; (3) they were
not to use the wild broom-stick; (4) they were not to set up permanent
ovens for cooking purposes, but to make impromptu stoves out of three
stones. Taking compassion on them, the D&#275;v&#257;ngas promised to
give the V&#299;ramushtis a small sum of money annually, and to
contribute towards their marriage expenses.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e6118width" id="pl7-409"><img src=
"images/pl7-409.jpg" alt="Viramushti." width="491" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Viramushti.</p>
</div>
<p>The V&#299;ramushtis are said to have become attached to the
K&#333;matis subsequent to the above incident. The story goes that some
K&#333;matis asked them to delay for three and half hours the march of
Vishnuvardh&#257;na R&#257;ja, who was advancing with a view to
marrying the daughter of one of them, named Vasavakanya (now deified
into Kanyakamma). This the V&#299;ramushtis did by entertaining the
R&#257;ja with their acrobatic feats. Meanwhile, the K&#333;matis made
a number of fire-pits, and put an end to themselves.
Vishnuvardh&#257;na arrived too late, and had his head cut off. The
V&#299;ramushtis prayed to Vasavakanya, inasmuch as they had lost both
the R&#257;ja, who promised them a grant of land in return for their
performance, and herself, who had promised to give a lump of gold to
each g&#333;tra. The K&#333;matis replied in a body that each family of
their caste would in future give the V&#299;ramushtis an annual present
of money, and help in defraying the expenses of their marriages.</p>
<p>In accordance with the above legends, the V&#299;ramushtis usually
beg only from D&#275;v&#257;ngas and K&#333;matis. When <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name="pb410">410</a>]</span>they
approach a village, they generally halt under a tree, and, early in the
morning, dress up as acrobats, and appear with daggers, sticks, etc.,
crying Good luck! Good luck! They caper about as they advance, and,
when they reach a D&#275;v&#257;nga or K&#333;mati house, perform their
acrobatic feats, and wind up with a eulogium of the caste. Money and
food are then doled out to them.</p>
<p>Whenever a D&#275;v&#257;nga, Lingayat K&#333;mati, or other
Ling&#257;yat wants to make a hero (v&#299;ra) of a deceased member of
his family, he sends for a V&#299;ramushti (or hero-maker), and has a
slab planted, with a recognised ceremonial, at the spot where he is
buried.</p>
<p>In a further note on the V&#299;ramushtis I am informed that they
correspond to the V&#299;rabhadra K&#257;yakams of the Canarese
Lingayats, like whom they dress up, and adorn themselves with small
lingams, the figure of V&#299;rabhadra, a sword, a plate bearing a
star, and heads of Asuras (demons). Every important Saivite temple has
one or two V&#299;ramushtis attached to it, and they are supposed to be
servants of the god Siva. One of their chief duties is to guard the
idol during processions, and on other occasions. If, during a car
procession, the car will not move, the V&#299;ramushtis cut themselves
with their swords until it is set in motion. There is a Tamil proverb
that the Siva Br&#257;hman (temple priest) eats well, whereas the
V&#299;ramushti hurts himself with the sword, and suffers much. The
custom is said to be dying out.</p>
<p>The principal occupation of the V&#299;ramushtis is begging from
B&#275;ri Chettis, D&#275;v&#257;ngas, K&#333;matis, and washermen. In
former days, they are said to have performed a ceremony called
p&#257;vadam. When an orthodox Ling&#257;yat was insulted, he would
swallow his lingam, and lie flat on the ground in front of the house
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name=
"pb411">411</a>]</span>of the offender, who had to collect some
Ling&#257;yats, who would send for a V&#299;ramushti. He had to arrive
accompanied by a pregnant V&#299;ramushti woman, p&#363;j&#257;ris
(priests) of Draupadi, Pachaiamman and Pothur&#257;ja temples, a
Sembadava p&#363;j&#257;ri, Pambaik&#257;rans, Udukkaik&#257;rans, and
some individuals belonging to the nearest Lingayat mutt. Arrived at the
house, the pregnant woman would sit down in front of the person lying
on the ground. With his sword the V&#299;ramushti man then made cuts in
his scalp and chest, and sprinkled the recumbent man with the blood. He
would then rise, and the lingam would come out of his mouth. Besides
feeding the people, the offender was expected to pay money as
p&#257;vadam to the V&#299;ramushtis and mutts.</p>
<p>Some V&#299;ramushtis style themselves Vast&#257;d, or athletes, in
reference to their professional occupation.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Wah&#257;bi.</b>&mdash;The Wah&#257;bis are a sect
of Muslim revivalists founded by Muhammad ibn &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l
Wahh&#257;b, who was born in A.D. 1691. Wah&#257;byism has been defined
as the Puritanism of Isl&#257;m, &ldquo;hated by the so-called orthodox
Musalm&#257;ns, as the Lutherans were hated by Leo, and the Covenanters
by Claverhouse.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6223src" href=
"#xd21e6223" name="xd21e6223src">1</a> It is recorded, in the Manual of
North Arcot (1895), that since 1806 (the year of the Vellore mutiny)
&ldquo;two alarms have been raised in the district, both at Vellore,
which is largely inhabited by Muhammadans. The last alarm <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>occurred in 1869. Early in May of that year,
anonymous petitions were received by the Joint Magistrate and the
Assistant Superintendent of Police, stating that the Wah&#257;bi
Muhammadans of Vellore were in league against Government, and had
arranged a plot for the massacre of all the European residents, in
which the 28th Regiment of Native Infantry, then stationed at Vellore,
was deeply implicated. An East Indian subordinate of the Public Works
Department also reported that he had overheard a Muhammadan munshi of
the Small Cause Court speaking to a shopman of his faith about the
seditious preaching of a certain Kh&#257;zi. The munshi was sent for,
and described what he said had occurred in a certain mosque, where
sedition had been openly advocated by a Wah&#257;bi missionary who had
recently arrived from Hyderabad, as well as by others.&rdquo; It
appeared, from the investigations of the Inspector-General of Police,
that the whole affair had been nothing more than a conspiracy among the
orthodox Muhammadans to arouse alarm regarding the designs of the
Wah&#257;bis, and to prevent these sectarians from frequenting their
mosques.</p>
<p><b>Wudder.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> Odd&#275;.</p>
<p><b>Wyn&#257;d.</b>&mdash;Returned, at times of census, as a
territorial division of Chetti. There are at Gudal&#363;r near the
boundary between the N&#299;lgiri district and Malabar, and in the
Wyn&#257;d, two classes called, respectively, Mand&#257;dan Chettis
(<i>q.v.</i>) and Wyn&#257;dan Chettis.</p>
<p>The following account of the Wyn&#257;dan or Wynaadan Chettis is
given in the Gazetteer of the N&#299;lgiris. &ldquo;They speak
Malay&#257;lam, and follow marumakkat&#257;yam (inheritance in the
female line). They say they were originally Vell&#257;las from
Coimbatore, followed makkat&#257;yam (inheritance from father to son),
spoke Tamil, and wore the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href=
"#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>Tamil top-knot. In proof of this,
they point out that at their weddings they still follow certain Tamil
customs, the bridegroom wearing a turban and a red cloth with a silver
girdle over it and being shaved, and the woman putting on petticoats
and nose-rings. They have headmen called Kolapallis, subordinate to
whom are Mantiris, but these are liable to be overruled by a n&#257;d
council. No wedding may take place without the headman&rsquo;s leave.
Two forms of marriage are recognised. In one, the couple exchange
garlands after the Tamil fashion, and the father (a relic of the
makkat&#257;yam system) conducts the ceremony. Preliminaries are
arranged by go-betweens, and the chief of the numerous rites is the
placing of a bracelet on the girl&rsquo;s upper arm under a pandal
(booth) before the priest and the assembled relatives. The other form
is simpler. The bridegroom goes to the girl&rsquo;s house with some men
friends, and, after a dinner there, a go-between puts on the bangle.
Before marriage, a t&#257;li-kettu ceremony resembling that of the
N&#257;yars is often gone through, all the girls of a family who are of
marriageable age having t&#257;lis tied round their necks on the same
day by a maternal uncle. Married women are allowed intimacy with their
husbands&rsquo; brothers. Widows are permitted to marry again. The dead
are usually burnt, but those who have met their deaths by accidents and
epidemics are buried. Water from a vessel containing rice and a gold
coin is poured into a dying person&rsquo;s mouth. Should the spirit of
the dead disturb the dreams of the relatives, a hut for it is built
under an astrologer&rsquo;s directions close to the house, and in this
lights are lit morning and evening, and periodical offerings of food
are made. The Wynaadan Chettis reverence the deities in the Ganapati,
Mah&#257;m&#257;ri and Kalimalai Tambir&#257;n temples near
Sultan&rsquo;s Battery, Airu Billi of the Kurumbas, and one or two
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=
"pb415">415</a>]</span>others. The women wear in their distended
ear-lobes gold discs which are so characteristic of the N&#257;yars,
and many necklaces. They wear two white cloths, tying one round the
waist and another across their breasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of Malabar, that the Wyn&#257;d or
Wynaadan Chettis &ldquo;claim to be S&#363;dras, and are in appearance
and customs very similar to the N&#257;yars. They are polluted by all
castes below N&#257;yars. Their marriage customs seem to be a mixture
of east and west coast practices. They follow the marumakkatt&#257;yam
system, and perform the t&#257;li-kettu kali&#257;nam; but this is done
on the tenth day after puberty, and two t&#257;lis have to be tied on
the girl, one by her maternal uncle, and one by the senior female of
her house. They also celebrate a regular marriage ceremony, at which a
bracelet is put on the bride&rsquo;s right arm, and bride and
bridegroom garland each other; while next morning a k&#257;nam or
bride-price has to be paid to the bride&rsquo;s karnavan (senior male
in a family). They are bold shik&#257;ris (sportsmen), and tiger
spearing is a favourite pastime, closely connected with their
religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tiger is encircled by a wall of netting six feet high,
which is gradually closed up, and then speared. The carcass is not
skinned, but is stretched on a pole, and hung up as a sacrifice to
their deity.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first"><b>Y&#257;dava.</b>&mdash;Y&#257;dava, meaning
descendants of king Y&#257;du, from whom Krishna was descended, has
been recorded as a synonym or title of Idaiyan, and a sub-division of
Golla and Koracha. There is a tradition among the Idaiyans that Krishna
was brought up by their caste. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416"

<p><b>Y&#257;k&#257;ri.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> Ek&#257;ri.</p>
<p><b>Y&#257;n&#257;di.</b>&mdash;The Y&#257;n&#257;dis are a
dark-skinned, platyrhine tribe, short of stature, who inhabit the
Telugu country. The name has been the subject of much etymological
speculation. Some derive it from a (privative) and nathu (lord or
protector), and it may mean those who are not included in the ruling or
principal caste. Again, it has been derived from yanam (boat) and adi
(means). But the Y&#257;n&#257;dis are not known to have plied, nor do
they now ply boats at Sr&#299;harikota, their chief place of residence,
which is on the coast. The word would seem to be derived from the
Sanskrit anadi, or those whose origin is not traceable. The people
perhaps elongated the vowel-sound, so that it became Y&#257;n&#257;di.
In like manner, the Native graduate of the Madras University talks of
himself as being, not a B.A. or M.A., but B.Ya. or M.Ya. And a
billiard-marker will call the game yeighty-yeight instead of
eighty-eight.</p>
<p>The tradition of the Y&#257;n&#257;dis as to their origin is very
vague. Some call themselves the original inhabitants of the wilds in
the neighbourhood of the Pulicat lake, where they hunted and fished at
will, until they were enslaved by the Reddis. Others say that the Reddi
(or Manchi?) Y&#257;n&#257;dis were originally Chenchus, a small but
superior class, and that they fled from oppression and violence from
the mountains in the west, and amalgamated themselves with the common
Y&#257;n&#257;dis. The common deity of both Chenchus and Manchi
Y&#257;n&#257;dis is Chenchu D&#275;vudu. Between the Y&#257;n&#257;di
and the Chenchu, however, there is no love lost. They can be seen
living close together, but not intermingling, on the Nallamalais, and
they differ in their social customs. Y&#257;n&#257;di Chenchu is said
to be the name given by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href=
"#pb417" name="pb417">417</a>]</span>Br&#257;hmans to the
Chenchus.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6275src" href="#xd21e6275" name=
"xd21e6275src">1</a> The following legend concerning the
Y&#257;n&#257;dis is narrated by Mackenzie.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6278src" href="#xd21e6278" name="xd21e6278src">2</a> &ldquo;Of
old, one named R&#257;ghava brought with him sixty families from
P&#257;can&#257;tti district, locating himself with them at
Sriharicotta, and, clearing the country, formed R&#257;ghavapuram. The
people by degrees spread through a few adjoining districts. A rishi,
who came from Benares, and was named Ambik&#275;svarer, resided in
Mad&rsquo;hy&#257;ranya (or the central wilderness), and there, daily
bathing in a river, paid homage to Siva. These wild people of their own
accord daily brought him fruits and edibles, putting them before him.
At length he inquired of them the reason. They replied that their
country was infested by a terrible serpent, and they wished to be
taught charms to destroy it, as well as charms for other needful
purposes. He taught them, and then vanished away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is an advantage for a European to have a Y&#257;n&#257;di as a
camp servant, as he can draw water from any caste well. The
Y&#257;n&#257;di can also wash, and carry water for Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>The animistic nature of their religion; the production of fire by
friction; the primitive hunting and fishing stage in which a number
remain; the almost raw animal food which they eat, after merely
scorching or heating the flesh of the game they kill, indicate that the
Y&#257;n&#257;dis have not yet emerged from a primitive stage of
culture. They make fire by friction with sticks from the following
trees:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><i lang="la-x-bio">Protium caudatum</i> (konda r&#257;gi).</li>
<li><i lang="la-x-bio">Bauhinia racemosa</i> (aree chettu).</li>
<li><i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus. sp.</i> (kallu jeevee chettu).</li>
<li><i lang="la-x-bio">Ptereospermum suberifolium</i> (tada).</li>
<li>A tree belonging to the Nat. Order Laurine&aelig;.</li>
<li><i lang="la-x-bio">Cordia monoica</i> (female tree).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418" name=
"pb418">418</a>]</span></p>
<p>Two sticks are prepared, one short, the other long. In the former a
square cavity is scooped out, and it is held firmly on the ground,
while the long stick is twisted rapidly to and fro in the cavity. No
charcoal powder is used, but a rag, or even dried leaves are set fire
to.</p>
<p>The head-quarters of the Y&#257;n&#257;dis is the island of
Sr&#299;harikota in the Nellore district. Their primitive condition
attracted notice in 1835, when the island came into the possession of
the Government, which endeavoured to ameliorate their position by
supplying them with a liberal allowance of grain, clothing, tobacco,
and money, in return for the jungle produce, which they collected. The
demand for labour naturally rose, and the Government offered to pay to
parents 2 annas 6 pies on the birth of a male, and 1 anna 3 pies on the
birth of a female child&mdash;a bounty on productivity justified by
special local causes. In 1858, the Government opened a school for the
teaching of Telugu, which was rendered attractive by offers of rice and
clothing to those who attended it. An industrial department gave
lessons in basket-making, and land was assigned for the cultivation of
chay-root (<i lang="la-x-bio">Oldenlandia umbellata</i>), which yields
the beautiful red dye formerly much employed in the dyeing of cotton
fabrics, but has had its nose put out of joint by the introduction of
aniline and alizarin dyes. But the industries proved unsuccessful, and
the strength of the school gradually declined, so that it was abolished
in 1877.</p>
<p>At the census, 1891, the Y&#257;n&#257;dis returned as many as 89
sub-divisions, of which the two most important numerically were Chenchu
and Manchi. A division into classes exists according to dietary,
occupation, residence, etc. There are, for example, the Reddi
Y&#257;n&#257;dis, the Challa (refuse-eating), Adavi, and Kappala
(frog-eaters). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>The Reddi Y&#257;n&#257;dis are a settled class,
employed chiefly as cooks by the Panta Reddis. They do not mingle with
the Challa and Adivi sections, whom they regard as out-castes. If a
Reddi Y&#257;n&#257;di woman&rsquo;s husband dies, abandons, or
divorces her, she may marry his brother, and, in the case of separation
or divorce, the two brothers will live on friendly terms with each
other. The Challas are also known as Garappa (dry-land) or Chatla
(tree). They reside in huts on the borders of villages in the service
of the community, and live on jungle produce, and by snaring and
hunting game. The Reddi and Challa Y&#257;n&#257;dis are occasionally
employed as k&#257;valgars, or village watchmen, in the Kistna and
God&#257;vari districts. In the Venkatagiri Zemind&#257;ri the
Y&#257;n&#257;dis are among the recognised servants of the village
community as procurers of charcoal for the blacksmith. The Adavi
Y&#257;n&#257;dis are, as the name implies, jungle-men. The Manchi or
good Y&#257;n&#257;dis are a small superior class. The
Y&#257;n&#257;dis of the North Arcot district, it may be noted, are
Chenchu worshippers, and go by that name. They are non-frog-eaters, and
do not permit the Kappala, or frog-eaters, even to touch their pots.
Some Y&#257;n&#257;dis of the Nellore district feed on the refuse of
the table. The Somari, or idle Y&#257;n&#257;dis, live in the Kavali
t&#257;luk of that district. They do scavenging work, and eat the
refuse food thrown away by people from the leaf plate after a meal.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nerigi M&#275;kala, a kind of goat.</li>
<li>Elugu, bear.</li>
<li>Thirlasetti, name of a Balija Chetti.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these names represent exogamous septs. In every case, the
house-name was known only to old men and women, and they, as a rule,
did not know the house-names of their neighbours or relations. Many of
the names are derived from villages, or persons of other castes, on
whose land they may live, and are probably new names adopted instead of
the original ones. For the purpose of their register, Forest officers
invent prefixes by which Y&#257;n&#257;dis with the same family name
can be distinguished, <i>e.g.</i>, Kee Chenchugadu, Permadu Budthagadu,
to distinguish them from other Chenchugadus, and Budthagadus. The same
practice is resorted to by planters, who give &ldquo;estate
names&rdquo; to their coolies.</p>
<p>Y&#257;n&#257;dis will not eat with M&#257;digas or Paraiyans, and
observe some principle in partaking of the refuse of the table. Thus,
for a Chinna Y&#257;n&#257;di to eat the refuse of the Mondis, Oddes,
or Yerukalas, would involve excommunication, which is always pronounced
by a Balija Chetti, whose decision is final and binding. Restoration to
caste can be secured by undergoing a personal ordeal, by giving a
feast, and promising good behaviour in the future. The ordeal takes the
form of scalding of the tongue with hot gold by the Balija Chetti. It
is curious that there has recently grown up a tendency for members of
other castes to join the Y&#257;n&#257;di community. There <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name="pb421">421</a>]</span>are
instances of barbers, weavers, fishermen, and even K&#333;matis being
admitted into the Y&#257;n&#257;di fold.</p>
<p>The headman, who goes by the name of Kulampedda or Pedda
Y&#257;n&#257;di, exercises general social control over a group, known
as a guddem, ordinarily of about twenty huts. He decides social
questions, sometimes on his own responsibility, by excommunicating or
fining; sometimes acting on the advice of a council of his castemen.
Until quite recently, the tribe remained under the guidance of a
hereditary leader of Sr&#299;harikota, who wielded immense power. The
Paraiyans have risen superior to the Y&#257;n&#257;dis as a community,
supplying among themselves their own artisans, weavers, carpenters,
barbers, priests, teachers, etc., while the Y&#257;n&#257;dis are only
just beginning to move in this direction.</p>
<p>The language of the Y&#257;n&#257;dis is Telugu, but some words are
compounds of Telugu and Tamil, <i>e.g.</i>, artichedi for plantain,
pandikutti for pig.</p>
<p>The Y&#257;n&#257;dis know the forest flora well, and the uses of
the various trees and shrubs, which yield good firewood, etc. They call
the roller (<i lang="la-x-bio">Coracias indica</i>) the milk bird, in
the belief that, when a cow goes dry, she will yield milk if a feather
of the roller is put in the grass for her to swallow. The crow-pheasant
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Centropus sinensis</i>) is to them the prickly-pear
crow; florikin the ground peacock; the fan-tail snipe the pond snipe;
and the pin-tail the rice field snipe.</p>
<p>At the census, 1891, 84,339 Y&#257;n&#257;dis were returned as
Hindus, and 549 as animists. Their places of worship are not temples,
but houses, called d&#275;vara indlu (houses of the gods), set apart
for every centre. They worship a household god, a village goddess of
local importance, and a deity of wider repute and influence. Chenchu
D&#275;vudu is invariably the household god. Poleramma or Ankamma
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422</a>]</span>is in charge of a local area for weal or woe.
Subbar&#257;yudu, Venkat&#275;swaralu, Panchala, Narasimhulu, and
others, are the gods who control destinies over a wider area. The
Y&#257;n&#257;dis are their own priests. The objects of worship take
various forms: a wooden idol at Sr&#299;harikota; bricks; stones; pots
of water with margosa (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>)
leaves; images of gods drawn on the walls of their houses; or mere
handfuls of clay squeezed into shape, and placed on a small platform
erected under an aruka tree, which, like other Hindus, they hold
sacred. They use a red powder, flowers, turmeric, etc., for worship;
burn camphor and incense; and distribute fruit, dh&#257;l (pulse of
<i lang="la-x-bio">Cajanus indicus</i>), and the like. In worshipping
ancestors, they resemble the Kurumbas. The house of the gods is a
sanctum, into which no polluting object is allowed to enter. The most
pious perform rites every Friday. At Sr&#299;harikota they do so once a
fortnight, or once a month. The ordinary Y&#257;n&#257;di only worships
on occasion of a marriage, funeral, etc. A belief lingers that the
pious are <i>en rapport</i> with the deity, who converses with them and
even inspires them. The goddess receives animal sacrifices, but Chenchu
D&#275;vudu is a strict vegetarian, whose votaries are bound, at times
of worship, to subsist on a single daily meal of roots and fruits. The
Y&#257;n&#257;dis, like Hindus, wear sect marks, and are even divided
into Vaishnavites and Saivites. They are supposed, during worship, to
endow inanimate objects, and the spirits of geographical features, with
life and mind, and supernatural powers. Some Y&#257;n&#257;dis are
converts to Christianity.</p>
<p>The Y&#257;n&#257;dis live in low conical huts, rudely built of
bamboo and palmyra leaves, grass, or millet stalks, with a small
entrance, through which grown-up people have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name="pb423">423</a>]</span>to
creep. The hut affords protection from the sun and rain, but the
Y&#257;n&#257;dis generally cook, eat, and sleep outside. The staple
food of the Y&#257;n&#257;dis, apart from bazar purchases, consists of
the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Animals:&mdash;S&#257;mbar deer, wild goat, bear, porcupine, boar,
land tortoise, hare, bandicoot and jerboa rat, <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Varanus</i> (lizard), mungoose, and fish.</p>
<p>Vegetables and fruit:&mdash;<i lang="la-x-bio">Dioscorea</i> (yams);
pith and fruit of <i lang="la-x-bio">Ph&oelig;nix sylvestris</i> (date
palm); fruit kernel of <i lang="la-x-bio">Cycas circinalis</i>, eaten
after thorough soaking in water; and fruits of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Eugenia alternifolia</i> and <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Jambolana</i> (black plum), <i lang="la-x-bio">Carissa
Carandas</i> and <i lang="la-x-bio">spinarum</i>, <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Buchanania acuminata</i>, and <i lang="la-x-bio">Mimusops
hexandra</i>.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e6467width" id="pl7-423"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">Y&#257;n&#257;dis.</p>
</div>
<p>They are, like the Irulas of Chingleput, very partial to sour and
fermented rice-water, which is kept by the higher classes for cattle.
This they receive in exchange for headloads of fuel. For some time past
they have been stopped by the Forest officers from drinking this
pulusun&#299;llu, as it makes them lazy, and unfit for work.</p>
<p>The marriage ceremony is no indispensable necessity. The Adavi
Y&#257;n&#257;dis, as a rule, avoid it; the Reddi Y&#257;n&#257;dis
always observe it. The parents rarely arrange alliances, the parties
concerned managing for themselves. Maturity generally precedes
marriage. Seduction and elopement are common occurrences, and divorce
is easily obtained. Adultery is no serious offence; widows may live in
concubinage; and pregnancy before marriage is no crime. By nature,
however, the Y&#257;n&#257;dis are jealous of conjugal rights, and
attached to their wives. Widowhood involves no personal disfigurement,
or denial of all the emblems of married life.</p>
<p>A widow has been known to take, one after another, as many as seven
husbands. The greater the number of her husbands, the more exalted is
the status of a widow <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href=
"#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>in society, and the stronger her
title to settle disputes on questions of adultery, and the like.
Polygamy is common, and a Y&#257;n&#257;di is known to have had as many
as seven wives, whom he housed separately, and with whom he lived by
turns. The marriage ceremony is undergoing change, and the simple
routine developing into a costly ceremonial, the details of which
(<i>e.g.</i>, the &ldquo;screen scene&rdquo;) are copied from the
marriage rites of higher castes in the Telugu country. Until quite
recently, the flower of the tang&#275;du (<i lang="la-x-bio">Cassia
auriculata</i>) did duty for the t&#257;li, which is now a
turmeric-dyed cotton thread with a gold bottu suspended from it. The
auspicious hour is determined by a very simple process. The hour is
noon, which arrives when a pole, two feet high, stuck vertically on the
marriage platform, ceases to throw a shadow. The pole has superseded
the arrow used of old, and sometimes a pur&#333;hit is consulted, and
gives the hour from his calendar.</p>
<p>As a punishment for adultery, the unfaithful woman is, at
Sr&#299;harikota, made to stand, with her legs tied, for a whole day in
the sun, with a basket full of sand on her head.</p>
<p>The maternal uncle receives a measure of rice, a new cloth, and
eight annas, at the head-shaving ceremony of his nephew. At this
ceremony, which is a borrowed custom, the uncle plucks a lock of hair
from the head of the lad, and ties it to a bough of the aruka tree. The
head is shaved, and the lad worships the village goddess, to whom a
fowl is offered. The guests are feasted, and the evening is spent in a
wild torch-light dance.</p>
<p>At the first menstrual period, a Y&#257;n&#257;di girl occupies a
hut erected for the purpose, which must have within it at least one
stick of <i lang="la-x-bio">Strychnos Nux-vomica</i>, to drive away
devils. On the ninth day the hut is burnt down, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name="pb425">425</a>]</span>and
the girl cleanses herself from pollution by bathing. A woman, after
confinement, feeds for three days on the tender leaves, or cabbage of
the date palm (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ph&oelig;nix sylvestris</i>), and
then on rice. Margosa leaves, and sometimes the leaves of other trees,
and the knife with which the umbilical cord was cut, are placed under
the infant&rsquo;s head for six days. A net is hung in front of the
door, to keep out devils. The baby is given a name by the soothsayer,
who pretends to be in communication on the subject with the god or
goddess.</p>
<p>The Y&#257;n&#257;dis pose as prophets of human destinies, and, like
the N&#299;lgiri Kurumbas, pretend to hold intercourse with gods and
goddesses, and to intercede between god and man. Every village or
circle has one or more soothsayers, who learn their art from experts
under a rigid routine. The period of pupilage is a fortnight spent on a
dietary of milk and fruits with no cooked meat, in a cloister in
meditation. The god or goddess Ankamma, Poleramma, Venkat&#275;swaralu,
Subbaroyadu, or Malakondroyadu, appears like a shadow, and inspires the
pupil, who, directly the period of probation has ceased, burns camphor
and frankincense. He then sings in praise of the deity, takes a sea
bath with his master, gives a sumptuous feast, and becomes an
independent soothsayer. The ardent soothsayer of old wrought miracles,
so runs the story, by stirring boiling rice with his hand, which was
proof against scald or hurt. His modern brother invokes the gods with
burning charcoal in his folded hands, to the beat of a drum. People
flock in large numbers to know the truth. The word is rangampattedhi in
North Arcot and sodi in Nellore. The soothsayer arranges Chenchu
D&#275;vudu and the local gods in a separate d&#275;vara illu or house
of god, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name=
"pb426">426</a>]</span>is always kept scrupulously clean, and where
worship is regularly carried on. The auspicious days for soothsaying
are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The chief soothsayer is a male. The
applicant presents him with betel nuts, fruit, flowers, and money. The
soothsayer bathes, and sits in front of his house smeared with black,
white, red, and other colours. His wife, or some other female, kindles
a fire, and throws frankincense into it. He beats his drum, and sings,
while a woman from within repeats the chant in a shrill voice. The
songs are in praise of the deity, at whose and the soothsayer&rsquo;s
feet the applicant prostrates himself and invokes their aid. The
soothsayer feels inspired, and addresses the supplicant thus:
&ldquo;You have neglected me. You do not worship me. Propitiate me
adequately, or ruin is yours.&rdquo; The future is predicted in song.
In these predictions the rural folk place abundant faith.</p>
<p>The Y&#257;n&#257;dis bury their dead. The corpse is laid on leaves
in front of the hut, washed and clad. P&#275;lalu (parched rice) is
thrown over the corpse by the son and all the agnates. It is eventually
placed on a bier, covered with a new cloth, and carried to the burial
ground, by the sons, or, in the absence thereof, the sapindas. At a
fixed spot near the grave, on which all corpses are placed, a cross is
drawn on the ground, the four lines of which represent the four
cardinal points of the compass. Close to the corpse are placed betel
leaves and nuts, and a copper coin. All present then proceed to the
spot where the grave is to be dug, while the corpse is left in charge
of a Y&#257;n&#257;di called the Bathyasthadu, who, as a rule, belongs
to a different sept from that of the deceased. The corpse is laid on a
cloth, face downwards, in the grave. The eldest son, followed by the
other relatives, throws three handfuls of earth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name="pb427">427</a>]</span>into
the grave, which is then filled in. On their return home, the mourners
undergo purification by bathing before entering their huts. In front of
the dead man&rsquo;s hut, two broken chatties (pots) are placed,
whereof one contains ash-water, the other turmeric-water. Into each
chatty a leafy twig is thrown. Those who have been present at the
funeral stop at the chatties, and, with the twig, sprinkle themselves
first with the ash-water, and then with the turmeric-water. Inside the
hut a lighted lamp, fed with gingelly oil, is set up, before which
those who enter make obeisance before eating.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e6508width" id="pl7-427"><img src=

</div>
<p>The chinnadinamu ceremony, whereof notice is given by the
Bathyasthadu, is usually held on the third day after death. Every group
(gudem) or village has its own <span class="corr" id="xd21e6515" title=
"Source: Bathyasthudu">Bathyasthadu</span>, specially appointed, whose
duty it is to convey the news of death, and puberty of girls, to all
the relatives. Tup&#257;kis will never nominate a Tup&#257;ki as their
Bathyastha, but will select from a M&#275;kala or any sept except their
own.</p>
<p>On the morning of the chinnadinamu, the eldest son of the deceased
cooks rice in a new pot, and makes curries and cakes according to his
means. These are made up into six balls, which are placed in a new
basket, and taken to the burial-ground. On reaching the spot where the
cross-lines were drawn, a ball of rice is placed thereon, together with
betel leaves and nuts and a copper coin. The Bathyasthadu remains in
charge thereof, while those assembled proceed to the grave, whereon a
pot of water is poured, and a stone planted at the spot beneath which
the head lies. The stone is anointed with shikai (fruit of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Acacia Concinna</i>) and red powder, and milk poured over
it, first by the widow or widower and then by the relations.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name=
"pb428">428</a>]</span>This ceremony concluded, the son places a ball
of rice at each corner of the grave, together with betel and money.
Milk is poured over the remaining ball, which is wrapped in a leaf, and
buried over the spot where the abdomen of the deceased is situated.
Close to the grave, at the southern or head end, three stones are set
up in the form of a triangle, whereon a new pot full of water is
placed. A hole is made in the bottom of the pot, and the water trickles
out towards the head of the corpse. This concludes the ceremony, and,
as on the day of the funeral, purification by bathing, ash-water and
turmeric-water, is carried out.</p>
<p>The peddadinamu ceremony is performed on the sixteenth, or some
later day after death. As on the chinnadinamu, the son cooks rice in a
new pot. Opposite the entrance to the hut a handful of clay is squeezed
into a conical mass, representing the soul of the deceased, and stuck
up on a platform. The eldest son, taking a portion of the cooked rice,
spreads it on a leaf in front of the clay image, before which incense
is burnt, and a lamp placed. The image, and the remainder of the food
made up into four balls, are then carried by the son to a tank (pond).
As soon as the relatives have assembled there, the recumbent effigy of
a man is made, close to the edge of the tank, with the feet towards the
north. The conical image is set up close to the head of the effigy,
which is anointed by the relatives as at the chinnadinamu, except that
no milk is poured over it. The four balls of rice are placed close to
the hands and feet of the effigy, together with betel and money, and
the son salutes it. The agnates then seat themselves in a row between
the effigy and the water, with their hands behind their backs, so as to
reach the effigy, which is moved slowly towards the water, into which
it finally falls, and becomes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429"
href="#pb429" name="pb429">429</a>]</span>disintegrated. The
proceedings conclude with distribution of cloths and cheroots, and
purification as before. The more prosperous Y&#257;n&#257;dis now
engage a Br&#257;hman to remove the pollution by sprinkling water over
them. During the peddadinamu incessant music and drum-beating has been
going on, and is continued till far into the night, and sometimes the
ceremonial is made to last over two days, in order that the
Y&#257;n&#257;dis may indulge in a bout of music and dancing.</p>
<p>The Y&#257;n&#257;dis are expert anglers, catching fish with a
triangular net or wicker basket. They also excel in diving for and
catching hold of fish concealed in crevices of rocks or buried in mud,
and assist European sportsmen by marking down florikin. Those who are
unable to count bring in a string with knots tied in it, to indicate
the number of birds marked. They catch bandicoot rats by a method known
as voodarapettuta. A pot is stuffed with grass, into which fire is
thrown. The mouth of the pot is placed against the hole made by the
bandicoot, and smoke blown into the hole through a small slit in the
pot. The animal becomes suffocated, and tries to escape through the
only aperture available, made for the occasion by the Y&#257;n&#257;di,
and, as it emerges, is killed. They are fearless in catching cobras,
which they draw out of their holes without any fear of their fangs.
They pretend to be under the protection of a charm, while so doing. A
correspondent writes that a cobra was in his grounds, and his servant
got a Y&#257;n&#257;di, who had charge of the adjoining garden, to
dislodge it. The man was anxious to catch it alive, and then, before
killing it, carefully removed the poison-sac with a knife, and
swallowed it as a protection against snake-bite.</p>
<p>The Y&#257;n&#257;dis are good shik&#257;ris (huntsmen), and devoid
of fear in the jungle. They hold licenses under the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name="pb430">430</a>]</span>Arms
Act, and being good shots, are great at bagging tigers, leopards,
porcupines, and other big and small game. After an unsuccessful beat
for spotted deer, a friend informs me, the Y&#257;n&#257;dis engaged
therein erected a cairn of twigs and stones several feet high, round
which they danced with gradually quickening step, to the refrain in
Telugu &lsquo;Nothing comes.&rsquo; Then, to the same tune, they danced
round it in the opposite direction. The incantation concluded, the beat
was continued and a stag duly appeared on the scene&mdash;and was
missed!</p>
<p>They gather honey from bee-hives on hill tops and cliffs which are
precipitous and almost inaccessible, and perilous to reach. The man
climbs down with the help of a plaited rope of pliant bamboo, fastened
above to a peg driven firmly into a tree or other hard substance, and
takes with him a basket and stick. He drives away the bees at the first
swing by burning grass or brushwood beneath the hives. The next swing
takes him closer to the hive, which he pokes with the stick. He
receives the honey-comb in the basket, and the honey flows out of it
into a vessel adjusted to it. When the basket and vessel are full, he
shakes the rope, and is drawn up by the person in charge of it, who is
almost always his wife&rsquo;s brother, so that there may be no foul
play. He thus collects a considerable quantity of honey and wax, for
which he receives only a subsistence wage from the contractor, who
makes a big profit for himself.</p>
<p>The following list of minor forest products, chiefly collected by
Government Y&#257;n&#257;dis, is given in the Nellore District

<p>In the interests of the Y&#257;n&#257;dis it is laid down, in the
Gazette, that &ldquo;the Y&#257;n&#257;di villages must be encouraged,
and the people paid at least once a week for the produce they collect.
This must be done by the maistry (overseer) going up and down the main
ride every day during the collection season, checking the collections,
and paying for them on the spot. The Y&#257;n&#257;dis will, of course,
camp out in the reserve when collecting produce, and not return, as
heretofore, every three days to Sriharikota, thus wasting 45 per cent.
of their time in the mere coming and going, apart from the fact that,
under the old system, the produce from some parts of the reserves was
never collected at all, as no one visited them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Y&#257;n&#257;dis dance on festive occasions, at ceremonies, and
occasionally for begging, smearing the body with turmeric, wearing
flowers, singing meaningless songs, and drumming in rude fashion
&ldquo;dambukku, dambukku.&rdquo; Their only wind instrument is the
bag-pipe, but they play on the snake charmer&rsquo;s reed as an
accompaniment. Their dance is full of indecent suggestion. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432" name="pb432">432</a>]</span>They
have of late trained themselves for the stage, and there are several
troupes of Bh&#257;gavathulu.</p>
<p>To the Rev. G. N. Thomssen, of the Telugu Mission, Bapatla, I am
indebted for the following account of a Y&#257;n&#257;di dance.
&ldquo;Especially at night, they love to gather in some part of the
jungle where they have their huts, and, having gathered a pile of
palmyra leaves, burn them one by one as torches, while a number of men
and women begin to dance their quaint, weird jungle dance, which is to
represent the experiences of the hunters in their wanderings. The chief
actors, or dancers, are dressed fantastically. They are almost nude,
but dangling from their loins are palmyra baskets, in which they gather
edible bulbs and roots, dead rats, snakes, etc., which are prized as
something to fill the stomach. Suddenly the actors fell on the ground.
One of them cries out &lsquo;th&#275;lu&rsquo; (scorpion). Then the
other asks where, and is shown the place where the scorpion is supposed
to have stung the sufferer, while the choir sing:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Alas! the scorpion stings.</p>
<p class="line">O! O! the scorpion stings.</p>
<p class="line">Which finger? Ah! the middle one.</p>
<p class="line">As soon as I was stung,</p>
<p class="line">The poison into my head ascends.</p>
<p class="line">Ayo! Ayo! What shall I do?</p>
<p class="line">Bring down the poison with yilledu.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This chant is kept up for a long time, when suddenly
another of the actors falls on the ground, and writhes like a snake.
The Y&#257;n&#257;dis are a very supple race, and, when dancing,
especially when writhing on the ground, one sees a display of muscular
action that makes one believe that the human body is capable of all the
twists and turns of a serpent. When the actor is representing the man
bitten by a snake, one hears quaint cries while <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433" name="pb433">433</a>]</span>the
snake is sought in the hair, ears, and nose, basket and loin-cloth. The
choir now sings the following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Come down to catch the snake,</p>
<p class="line">O! snake-charmer, behold the standing snake.</p>
<p class="line">Be sure the pipe sounds well.</p>
<p class="line">Come, come, with the big snakes in the basket,</p>
<p class="line">And the little ones in the lock of your hair.</p>
<p class="line">When I went down the bank of the Yerracheru,</p>
<p class="line">And saw the harvest cut,</p>
<p class="line">The cobra crawled beneath the harvester.</p>
<p class="line">Ayo! Ayo! Ayo!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To see this action song, and to hear these strange
people, is one of the queerest experiences of native aboriginal life.
The dancers, and the spectators who form the choir, all become very
excited, and even the European, seeing the tam&#257;sha (spectacle), is
infected with the excitement. The actors are bathed in perspiration,
but the dance is kept up nevertheless, and only when their large stock
of palmyra leaf torches is exhausted will they stop and take their
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their nomadic life the Y&#257;n&#257;dis have learnt by
experience the properties and uses of herbs and roots, with which they
treat fever, rheumatism, and other diseases. They have their own
remedies for cobra bite and scorpion sting. It is said that the
Y&#257;n&#257;dis alone are free from elephantiasis, which affects the
remaining population of Sriharikota.</p>
<p>It is noted by the Rev. G. N. Thomssen that &ldquo;while it has been
impossible to gather these people into schools, because of their
shyness and jungle wildness, Christian missionaries, especially the
American Baptist missionaries, have succeeded in winning the confidence
of these degraded children of nature, and many of them have joined the
Christian Church. Some read and write well, and a few have even learned
English. We have a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434"
name="pb434">434</a>]</span>small, but growing settlement of
Christianised Y&#257;n&#257;dis at Bapatla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To sum up the Y&#257;n&#257;di. It is notorious that, in times of
scarcity, he avoids the famine relief works, for the simple reason that
he does not feel free on them. Nevertheless, a few are in the police
service. Some are k&#257;valgars (watchmen), farm labourers,
scavengers, stone-masons or bricklayers, others are pounders of rice,
or domestic servants, and are as a rule faithful. They earn a
livelihood also in various subsidiary ways, by hunting, fishing,
cobra-charming, collecting honey or fuel, rearing and selling pigs,
practicing medicine as quacks, and by thieving. &ldquo;An iron
implement,&rdquo; Mr. F. S. Mullaly writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6669src" href="#xd21e6669" name="xd21e6669src">3</a> called the
sikkaloo k&#333;l, is kept by them ostensibly for the purpose of
digging roots, but it is really their jemmy, and used in the commission
of burglary. It is an ordinary iron tool, pointed at both ends, one end
being fitted in a wooden handle. With this they can dig through a wall
noiselessly and quickly, and many houses are thus broken into in one
night, until a good loot is obtained. House-breakings are usually
committed during the first quarter of the moon. Y&#257;n&#257;dis
confess their own crimes readily, but will never implicate
accomplices.... Women are useful in the disposal of stolen property. At
dusk they go round on their begging tours selling mats, which they
make, and take the opportunity of dropping a word to the women of cheap
things for sale, and the temptation is seldom resisted. Stolen property
is also carried in their marketing baskets to the village grocer, the
K&#333;mati. Among the wild (Adavi) Y&#257;n&#257;dis, women are told
off to acquire information while begging, but they chiefly rely on the
liquor-shopkeepers for news, which may be turned to useful
account.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6672src" href="#xd21e6672"
name="xd21e6672src">4</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href=
"#pb435" name="pb435">435</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>Y&#257;n&#257;ti.</b>&mdash;The Y&#257;n&#257;tis,
Y&#275;n&#275;tis, or &#274;n&#275;tis, are a class of cultivators in
the Ganjam and Vizagapatam districts, between whom and the
Y&#257;n&#257;dis some confusion has arisen. For example, it is noted,
in the Madras Census Report, 1891, that it is curious to find the
Y&#257;n&#257;di sub-division of the Velamas so strongly represented,
for there is at the present day a wide gulf between Velamas and
Y&#257;n&#257;dis. Again, in the Census Report, 1901, it is noticed
under the heading Y&#257;n&#257;ti that &ldquo;entries of this name
were clubbed with Y&#257;n&#257;di, but it has since been reported
that, in Bissumcuttack taluk of the Vizagapatam Agency, there is a
separate caste called Y&#257;n&#257;ti or Y&#275;n&#275;ti Dora, which
is distinct from either Y&#257;n&#257;di or Konda Dora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that the Y&#257;n&#257;tis of Ganjam also go by the name
of Entamara and Gainta or Gayinta.</p>
<p><b>Y&#257;ta.</b>&mdash;The Y&#257;tas are the toddy-drawers of
Ganjam and Vizagapatam. The caste name is a corrupt form of ita,
meaning date palm, from which the toddy is secured. It is noted, in the
Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district, that &ldquo;toddy is obtained
from the palmyra (<i lang="la-x-bio">Borassus flabellifer</i>) and date
palm (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ph&oelig;nix sylvestris</i>). The
toddy-drawers are usually of the Y&#257;ta and Segidi castes. The
palmyra is tapped by cutting off the end of the flower spathe, and the
date palm by making an incision, like an inverted V, close under the
crown of leaves. In the zamindaris, little care is taken to see that
date trees are not over-tapped, and hundreds of trees may be seen
ruined, and even killed by excessive tapping.&rdquo; Many members of
the caste are engaged in the manufacture of baskets and boxes from palm
leaves. The Y&#257;tas are said to be responsible for a good deal of
the crime in portions of the Vizagapatam district.</p>
<p>For the following note on the Y&#257;tas of the Vizagapatam
district, I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name="pb436">436</a>]</span>They
are a Telugu-speaking people, and the caste is organised on the same
lines as many other Telugu castes. In each locality where they are
settled, there is a headman called Kulampedda, who, with the assistance
of the caste elders, settles disputes and affairs affecting the
community. The caste is, like other Telugu castes, divided up into
numerous intip&#275;rus or exogamous septs. The custom of
m&#275;narikam, according to which a man marries his maternal
uncle&rsquo;s daughter, is the rule. If the girl, whom a man claims in
accordance with this custom, is not given to him, his mother raises
such a howl that her brother is compelled by the castemen to come to
terms. If he still refuses to give up his daughter, and bestows her on
another man, the protest of his sister is said to destroy the happiness
of the pair. Girls are married before or after puberty. The marriage
ceremonies last over three days, and are carried out either at the
house of the bride or bridegroom, the former if the parents are
prosperous and influential people in the community. A Br&#257;hman
officiates, and ties the satam&#257;nam on the bride&rsquo;s neck. On
the evening of the third day, at the bride&rsquo;s house, presents
called katnam, in the shape of rings, waist-bands, and a gold bangle
for the right upper arm, are given to the bridegroom. The value of
these presents bears a fixed proportion to that of the v&#333;li or
bride-price. The pair live for three days at the bride&rsquo;s house,
and then proceed to the house of the bridegroom, where they stay during
the next three days. They then return to the home of the bride, where
they once more stay for three days, at the end of which the bridegroom
returns to his house. The consummation ceremony is a separate event,
and, if the girl has reached puberty, takes place a few days after the
marriage ceremony. The remarriage of widows is permitted. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name="pb437">437</a>]</span>The
satam&#257;nam is tied on the bride&rsquo;s neck by the Kulampedda.
Divorce is also recognised, and a man marrying a divorced woman has to
pay twelve rupees, known as mogan&#257;ltappu, or new husband&rsquo;s
fine. The divorced woman has to return all the jewellery which was
given to her by her former husband.</p>
<p>The dead are cremated, and a man of the washerman caste usually
assists in igniting the pyre. There is an annual ceremony in memory of
the dead, at which the house is cleaned, and purified with cow-dung. A
meal on a more than usually liberal scale is cooked, and incense and
camphor are burnt before the entrance to the house. Food is then
offered to the dead, who are invoked by name, and the celebrants of the
rite partake of a hearty meal.</p>
<p>The usual caste titles are Naidu and Setti.</p>
<p><b>Yeddula</b> (bulls).&mdash;An exogamous sept of B&#333;ya and
K&#257;pu.</p>
<p><b>Y&#275;du M&#257;dala</b> (seven madalas).&mdash;The name of a
section of Upparas, indicating the amount of the bride-price. A
m&#257;dala is equivalent to two rupees.</p>
<p><b>Yelka M&#275;ti</b> (good rat).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
B&#333;ya.</p>
<p><b>Yemme.</b>&mdash;Yemme, Emme, or Yemmalav&#257;ru, meaning
buffalo or buffalo people, has been recorded as an exogamous sept of
B&#275;dar or B&#333;ya, Kurni, Kuruba, M&#257;diga, and Vakkaliga.</p>
<p><b>Yenne</b> (oil).&mdash;A sub-division of G&#257;niga.</p>
<p><b>Y&#275;nuga.</b>&mdash;Y&#275;nuga or Y&#275;nigala, meaning
elephant, has been recorded as an exogamous sept of K&#257;pu, the
members of which will not touch ivory.</p>
<p><b>Y&#275;numala.</b>&mdash;Y&#275;numala or Y&#275;namaloru,
meaning buffalo or buffalo people, has been recorded as an exogamous
sept of Balija, B&#333;ya, M&#257;diga, and Odd&#275;. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name="pb438">438</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>Yeravallar.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> Eravallar.</p>
<p><b>Yerlam.</b>&mdash;A division of K&#257;pus, so called after a
Br&#257;hman girl named Yerlamma, who was excommunicated for not being
married, and bore children to a K&#257;pu.</p>
<p><b>Yerra</b> (red).&mdash;A sub-division of Golla and K&#257;pu, and
an exogamous sept of D&#275;v&#257;nga.</p>
<p><b>Yerud&#257;ndi.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> Erud&#257;ndi.</p>
<p><b>Y&#333;gi Gurukkal.</b>&mdash;The Y&#333;gi Gurukkals are
described in the Madras Census Report, 1891, as &ldquo;a
Malay&#257;lam-speaking beggar caste. They are also priests in
K&#257;li temples, and pial schoolmasters. They bury their dead in a
sitting posture (like Sany&#257;sis).&rdquo; The pial, it may be noted,
is a raised platform under the verandah, or on either side of the door
of a house, in which village schools are held.</p>
<p>The Y&#333;gi Gurukkals are scattered about Malabar, and their chief
occupation seems to be the performance of worship to K&#257;li or
Durga. They officiate as priests for Mukkuvans and Tiyans. Among the
Mukkuvans, p&#363;ja (worship) to K&#257;li at the annual festival has
to be done by a Y&#333;gi Gurukkal, whereas, on ordinary occasions, it
may be done by a Mukkuvan, provided that he has been initiated by a
Y&#333;gi Gurukkal. In their customs, the Y&#333;gi Gurukkals closely
follow the N&#257;yars.</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of Malabar, that &ldquo;the
Y&#333;gi Gurukkals of North Malabar are a caste which, though low in
the social scale, is not regarded as conveying distance pollution. They
perform sakti p&#363;ja in their own houses, to which no one outside
the caste is allowed to attend; they also perform it for N&#257;yars
and Tiyans. They are celebrated sorcerers and exorcists, and are also
schoolmasters by profession.&rdquo;</p>
